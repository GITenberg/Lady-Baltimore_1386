           With the Affection and Memories of All My Life
      </pre>
    <p>
      To the Reader
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the great text in Burns, I am sure, where he wishes he could see
      himself as others see him. Well, here lies the hitch in many a work of
      art: if its maker&mdash;poet, painter, or novelist&mdash;could but have
      become its audience too, for a single day, before he launched it
      irrevocably upon the uncertain ocean of publicity, how much better his
      boat would often sail! How many little touches to the rigging he would
      give, how many little drops of oil to the engines here and there, the need
      of which he had never suspected, but for that trial trip! That&rsquo;s where the
      ship-builders and dramatists have the advantage over us others: they can
      dock their productions and tinker at them. Even to the musician comes this
      useful chance, and Schumann can reform the proclamation which opens his
      B-flat Symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, to publish a story in weekly numbers previously to its appearance
      as a book does sometimes give to the watchful author an opportunity to
      learn, before it is too late, where he has failed in clearness; and it
      brings him also, through the mails, some few questions that are pleasant
      and proper to answer when his story sets forth united upon its journey of
      adventure among gentle readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      How came my hero by his name?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you will open a book more valuable than any I dare hope to write, and
      more entertaining too, The Life of Paul Jones, by Mr. Buell, you will find
      the real ancestor of this imaginary boy, and fall in love with John
      Mayrant the First, as did his immortal captain of the Bon Homme Richard.
      He came from South Carolina; and believing his seed and name were perished
      there to-day, I gave him a descendant. I have learned that the name, until
      recently, was in existence; I trust it will not seem taken in vain in
      these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence came such a person as Augustus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our happier cities produce many Augustuses, and may they long continue to
      do so! If Augustus displeases any one, so much the worse for that one, not
      for Augustus. To be sure, he doesn&rsquo;t admire over heartily the parvenus of
      steel or oil, whose too sudden money takes them to the divorce court; he
      calls them the &lsquo;yellow rich&rsquo;; do you object to that? Nor does he think
      that those Americans who prefer their pockets to their patriotism, are
      good citizens. He says of such people that &lsquo;eternal vigilance cannot watch
      liberty and the ticker at the same time.&rsquo; Do you object to that? Why, the
      young man would be perfect, did he but attend his primaries and vote more
      regularly,&mdash;and who wants a perfect young man?
    </p>
    <p>
      What would John Mayrant have done if Hortense had not challenged him as
      she did?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never known, and I fear we might have had a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the old ladies really have spoken to Augustus about the love
      difficulties of John Mayrant?
    </p>
    <p>
      I must plead guilty. The old ladies of Kings Port, like American
      gentlefolk everywhere, keep family matters sacredly inside the family
      circle. But you see, had they not told Augustus, how in the world could I
      have told&mdash;however, I plead guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain passages have been interpreted most surprisingly to signify a
      feeling against the colored race, that is by no means mine. My only wish
      regarding these people, to whom we owe an immeasurable responsibility, is
      to see the best that is in them prevail. Discord over this seems on the
      wane, and sane views gaining. The issue sits on all our shoulders, but
      local variations call for a sliding scale of policy. So admirably
      dispassionate a novel as The Elder Brother, by Mr. Jervey, forwards the
      understanding of Northerners unfamiliar with the South, and also that
      friendliness between the two places, which is retarded chiefly by tactless
      newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, tact should have been one of the cardinal virtues; and if I didn&rsquo;t
      possess a spice of it myself, I should here thank by name certain two
      members of the St. Michael family of Kings Port for their patience with
      this comedy, before ever it saw the light. Tact bids us away from many
      pleasures; but it can never efface the memory of kindness.

    <h2>
      I: A Word about My Aunt
    </h2>
    <p>
      Like Adam, our first conspicuous ancestor, I must begin, and lay the blame
      upon a woman; I am glad to recognize that I differ from the father of my
      sex in no important particular, being as manlike as most of his sons.
      Therefore it is the woman, my Aunt Carola, who must bear the whole
      reproach of the folly which I shall forthwith confess to you, since she it
      was who put it into my head; and, as it was only to make Eve happy that
      her husband ever consented to eat the disastrous apple, so I, save to
      please my relative, had never aspired to become a Selected Salic Scion. I
      rejoice now that I did so, that I yielded to her temptation. Ours is a
      wide country, and most of us know but our own corner of it, while, thanks
      to my Aunt, I have been able to add another corner. This, among many other
      enlightenments of navel and education, do I owe her; she stands on the
      threshold of all that is to come; therefore I were lacking in deference
      did I pass her and her Scions by without due mention,&mdash;employing no
      English but such as fits a theme so stately. Although she never left the
      threshold, nor went to Kings Port with me, nor saw the boy, or the girl,
      or any part of what befell them, she knew quite well who the boy was. When
      I wrote her about him, she remembered one of his grandmothers whom she had
      visited during her own girlhood, long before the war, both in Kings Port
      and at the family plantation; and this old memory led her to express a
      kindly interest in him. How odd and far away that interest seems, now that
      it has been turned to cold displeasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some other day, perhaps, I may try to tell you much more than I can tell
      you here about Aunt Carola and her Colonial Society&mdash;that apple which
      Eve, in the form of my Aunt, held out to me. Never had I expected to feel
      rise in me the appetite for this particular fruit, though I had known such
      hunger to exist in some of my neighbors. Once a worthy dame of my town, at
      whose dinner-table young men and maidens of fashion sit constantly, asked
      me with much sentiment if I was aware that she was descended from
      Boadicea. Why had she never (I asked her) revealed this to me before? And
      upon her informing me that she had learned it only that very day, I
      exclaimed that it was a great distance to have descended so suddenly. To
      this, after a look at me, she assented, adding that she had the good news
      from the office of The American Almanach de Gotha, Union Square, New York;
      and she recommended that publication to me. There was but a slight fee to
      pay, a matter of fifty dollars or upwards, and for this trifling sum you
      were furnished with your rightful coat-of-arms and with papers clearly
      tracing your family to the Druids, the Vestal Virgins, and all the best
      people in the world. Therefore I felicitated the Boadicean lady upon the
      illustrious progenitrix with whom the Almanach de Gotha had provided her
      for so small a consideration, and observed that for myself I supposed I
      should continue to rest content with the thought that in our enlightened
      Republic every American was himself a sovereign. But that, said the lady,
      after giving me another look, is so different from Boadicea! And to this I
      perfectly agreed. Later I had the pleasure to hear in a roundabout way
      that she had pronounced me one of the most agreeable young men in society,
      though sophisticated. I have not cherished this against her; my gift of
      humor puzzles many who can see only my refinement and my scrupulous
      attention to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed, I counted myself proof against all Boadiceas. But you have
      noticed&mdash;have you not?&mdash;how, whenever a few people gather
      together and style themselves something, and choose a president, and eight
      or nine vice-presidents, and a secretary and a treasurer, and a committee
      on elections, and then let it be known that almost nobody else is
      qualified to belong to it, that there springs up immediately in hundreds
      and thousands of breasts a fiery craving to get into that body? You may
      try this experiment in science, law, medicine, art, letters, society,
      farming, I care not what, but you will set the same craving afire in
      doctors, academicians, and dog breeders all over the earth. Thus, when my
      Aunt&mdash;the president, herself, mind you!&mdash;said to me one day that
      she thought, if I proved my qualifications, my name might be favorably
      considered by the Selected Salic Scions&mdash;I say no more; I blush,
      though you cannot see me; when I am tempted, I seem to be human, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, to be sure, I met Aunt Carola&rsquo;s suggestion in the way that I am
      too ready to meet many of her remarks; for you must know she once, with
      sincere simplicity and good-will, told my Uncle Andrew (her husband; she
      is only my Aunt by marriage) that she had married beneath her; and she
      seemed unprepared for his reception of this candid statement: Uncle Andrew
      was unaffectedly merry over it. Ever since then all of us wait hopefully
      every day for what she may do or say next.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is from old New York, oldest New York; the family manor is still
      habitable, near Cold Spring; she was, in her youth, handsome, I am assured
      by those whose word I have always trusted; her appearance even to-day
      causes people to turn and look; she is not tall in feet and inches&mdash;I
      have to stoop considerably when she commands from me the familiarity of a
      kiss; but in the quality which we call force, in moral stature, she must
      be full eight feet high. When rebuking me, she can pronounce a single
      word, my name, &ldquo;Augustus!&rdquo; in a tone that renders further remark needless;
      and you should see her eye when she says of certain newcomers in our
      society, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know them.&rdquo; She can make her curtsy as appalling as a
      natural law; she knows also how to &ldquo;take umbrage,&rdquo; which is something that
      I never knew any one else to take outside of a book; she is a highly
      pronounced Christian, holding all Unitarians wicked and all Methodists
      vulgar; and once, when she was talking (as she does frequently) about King
      James and the English religion and the English Bible, and I reminded her
      that the Jews wrote it, she said with displeasure that she made no doubt
      King James had&mdash;&ldquo;well, seen to it that all foreign matter was
      expunged&rdquo;&mdash;I give you her own words. Unless you have moved in our
      best American society (and by this I do not at all mean the lower classes
      with dollars and no grandfathers, who live in palaces at Newport, and look
      forward to every-thing and back to nothing, but those Americans with
      grandfathers and no dollars, who live in boarding-houses, and look forward
      to nothing and back to everything)&mdash;unless you have known this
      haughty and improving milieu, you have never seen anything like my Aunt
      Carola. Of course, with Uncle Andrew&rsquo;s money, she does not live in a
      boarding-house; and I shall finish this brief attempt to place her before
      you by adding that she can be very kind, very loyal, very public-spirited,
      and that I am truly attached to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon your mother&rsquo;s side of the family,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; I did not have to feign amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Aunt was silent. &ldquo;Me descended from a king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Aunt nodded with an indulgent stateliness. &ldquo;There seems to be the
      possibility of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Royal blood in my veins, Aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said so, Augustus. Why make me repeat it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now, I fear, that I met Aunt Carola in that unfitting spirit, that
      volatile mood, which, as I have said already, her remarks often rouse in
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from what sovereign may I hope that I&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will consult a recent admirable compilation, entitled The American
      Almanach de Gotha, you will find that Henry the Seventh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt, I am so much relieved! For I think that I might have hesitated to
      trace it back had you said&mdash;well&mdash;Charles the Second, for
      example, or Elizabeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point I should have been wise to notice my Aunt&rsquo;s eye; but I did
      not, and I continued imprudently:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though why hesitate? I have never heard that there was anybody present to
      marry Adam and Eve, and so why should we all make such a to-do about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augustus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered my name in that quiet but prodigious tone to which I have
      alluded above.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I who was now silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augustus, if you purpose trifling, you may leave the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt, I beg your pardon. I never meant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand what impels you to adopt such a manner to me, when I
      am trying to do something for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to strengthen my apologies with a manner becoming the possible
      descendant of a king toward a lady of distinction, and my Aunt was pleased
      to pass over my recent lapse from respect. She now broached her favorite
      topic, which I need scarcely tell you is genealogy, beginning with her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your title to royal blood,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;were as plain as mine (through
      Admiral Bombo, you know), you would not need any careful research.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told me a great deal of genealogy, which I spare you; it was not one
      family tree, it was a forest of them. It gradually appeared that a
      grandmother of my mother&rsquo;s grandfather had been a Fanning, and there were
      sundry kinds of Fannings, right ones and wrong ones; the point for me was,
      what kind had mine been? No family record showed this. If it was Fanning
      of the Bon Homme Richard variety, or Fanning of the Alamance, then I was
      no king&rsquo;s descendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy New England people, I understand,&rdquo; said my Aunt with her nod of
      indulgent stateliness, referring to the Bon Homme Richard species, &ldquo;but of
      entirely bourgeois extraction&mdash;Paul Jones himself, you know, was a
      mere gardener&rsquo;s son&mdash;while the Alamance Fanning was one of those
      infamous regulators who opposed Governor Tryon. Not through any such
      cattle could you be one of us,&rdquo; said my Aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a dim, distant, hitherto uncharted Henry Tudor Fanning had fought in
      some of the early Indian wars, and the last of his known blood was
      reported to have fallen while fighting bravely at the battle of Cowpens.
      In him my hope lay. Records of Tarleton, records of Marion&rsquo;s men, these
      were what I must search, and for these I had best go to Kings Port. If I
      returned with Kinship proven, then I might be a Selected Salic Scion, a
      chosen vessel, a royal seed, one in the most exalted circle of men and
      women upon our coasts. The other qualifications were already mine:
      ancestors colonial and bellicose upon land and sea&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;besides having acquired,&rdquo; my Aunt was so good as to say,
      &ldquo;sufficient personal presentability since your life in Paris, of which I
      had rather not know too much, Augustus. It is a pity,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;that
      you will have so much research. With my family it was all so
      satisfactorily clear through Kill-devil Bombo&mdash;Admiral Bombo&rsquo;s
      spirited, reckless son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You will readily conceive that I did not venture to betray my ignorance of
      these Bombos; I worked my eyebrows to express a silent and timeworn
      familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Kings Port. You need a holiday, at any rate. And I,&rdquo; my Aunt
      handsomely finished, &ldquo;will make the journey a present to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This generosity made me at once, and sincerely, repentant for my flippancy
      concerning Charles the Second and Elizabeth. And so, partly from being
      tempted by this apple of Eve, and partly because recent overwork had tired
      me, but chiefly for her sake, and not to thwart at the outset her
      kindly-meant ambitions for me, I kissed the hand of my Aunt Carola and set
      forth to Kings Port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back one of us,&rdquo; was her parting benediction.

    <h2>
      II: I Vary My Lunch
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus it was that I came to sojourn in the most appealing, the most lovely,
      the most wistful town in America; whose visible sadness and distinction
      seem also to speak audibly, speak in the sound of the quiet waves that
      ripple round her Southern front, speak in the church-bells on Sunday
      morning, and breathe not only in the soft salt air, but in the perfume of
      every gentle, old-fashioned rose that blooms behind the high garden walls
      of falling mellow-tinted plaster: Kings Port the retrospective, Kings Port
      the belated, who from her pensive porticoes looks over her two rivers to
      the marshes and the trees beyond, the live-oaks, veiled in gray moss,
      brooding with memories! Were she my city, how I should love her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But though my city she cannot be, the enchanting image of her is mine to
      keep, to carry with me wheresoever I may go; for who, having seen her,
      could forget her? Therefore I thank Aunt Carola for this gift, and for
      what must always go with it in my mind, the quiet and strange romance
      which I saw happen, and came finally to share in. Why it is that my Aunt
      no longer wishes to know either the boy or the girl, or even to hear their
      names mentioned, you shall learn at the end, when I have finished with the
      wedding; for this happy story of love ends with a wedding, and begins in
      the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange, which the ladies of Kings Port have established, and
      (I trust) lucratively conduct, in Royal Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Royal Street! There&rsquo;s a relevance in this name, a fitness to my errand;
      but that is pure accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Woman&rsquo;s Exchange happened to be there, a decorous resort for those who
      became hungry, as I did, at the hour of noon each day. In my very pleasant
      boarding-house, where, to be sure, there was one dreadful boarder, a tall
      lady, whom I soon secretly called Juno&mdash;but let unpleasant things
      wait&mdash;in the very pleasant house where I boarded (I had left my hotel
      after one night) our breakfast was at eight, and our dinner not until
      three: sacred meal hours in Kings Port, as inviolable, I fancy, as the
      Declaration of Independence, but a gap quite beyond the stretch of my
      Northern vitals. Therefore, at twelve, it was my habit to leave my Fanning
      researches for a while, and lunch at the Exchange upon chocolate and
      sandwiches most delicate in savor. As, one day, I was luxuriously biting
      one of these, I heard his voice and what he was saying. Both the voice and
      the interesting order he was giving caused me, at my small table, in the
      dim back of the room, to stop and watch him where he stood in the light at
      the counter to the right of the entrance door. Young he was, very young,
      twenty-two or three at the most, and as he stood, with hat in hand,
      speaking to the pretty girl behind the counter, his head and side-face
      were of a romantic and high-strung look. It was a cake that he desired
      made, a cake for a wedding; and I directly found myself curious to know
      whose wedding. Even a dull wedding interests me more than other dull
      events, because it can arouse so much surmise and so much prophecy; but in
      this wedding I instantly, because of his strange and winning
      embarrassment, became quite absorbed. How came it he was ordering the cake
      for it? Blushing like the boy that he was entirely, he spoke in a most
      engaging voice: &ldquo;No, not charged; and as you don&rsquo;t know me, I had better
      pay for it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Self-possession in his speech he almost had; but the blood in his cheeks
      and forehead was beyond his control.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reply came from behind the counter: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect payment until
      delivery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;a&mdash;but on that morning I shall be rather particularly
      engaged.&rdquo; His tones sank almost away on these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should prefer to wait, then. You will leave your address. In
      half-pound boxes, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boxes? Oh, yes&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t thought&mdash;no&mdash;just a big, round
      one. Like this, you know!&rdquo; His arms embraced a circular space of air.
      &ldquo;With plenty of icing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not think that there was any smile on the other side of the counter;
      there was, at any rate, no hint of one in the voice. &ldquo;And how many
      pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was again staggered. &ldquo;Why&mdash;a&mdash;I never ordered one before. I
      want plenty&mdash;and the very best, the very best. Each person would eat
      a pound, wouldn&rsquo;t they? Or would two be nearer? I think I had better leave
      it all to you. About like this, you know.&rdquo; Once more his arms embraced a
      circular space of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this I had never heard the young lady behind the counter enter into
      any conversation with a customer. She would talk at length about all sorts
      of Kings Port affairs with the older ladies connected with the Exchange,
      who were frequently to be found there; but with a customer, never. She
      always took my orders, and my money, and served me, with a silence and a
      propriety that have become, with ordinary shopkeepers, a lost art. They
      talk to one indeed! But this slim girl was a lady, and consequently did
      the right thing, marking and keeping a distance between herself and the
      public. To-day, however, she evidently felt it her official duty to guide
      the hapless young, man amid his errors. He now appeared to be committing a
      grave one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure you want that?&rdquo; the girl was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Baltimore? Yes, that is what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she began to explain, then hesitated, and looked at him.
      Perhaps it was in his face; perhaps it was that she remembered at this
      point the serious difference between the price of Lady Baltimore (by my
      small bill-of-fare I was now made acquainted with its price) and the cost
      of that rich article which convention has prescribed as the cake for
      weddings; at any rate, swift, sudden delicacy of feeling prevented her
      explaining any more to him, for she saw how it was: his means were too
      humble for the approved kind of wedding cake! She was too young, too
      unskilled yet in the world&rsquo;s ways, to rise above her embarrassment; and so
      she stood blushing at him behind the counter, while he stood blushing at
      her in front of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he succeeded in speaking. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, I believe. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his hastily departing back she, too, murmured: &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I knew it I had screamed out loudly from my table: &ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t
      told you the day he wants it for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she knew it she had flown to the door&mdash;my cry had set her
      going, as if I had touched a spring&mdash;and there he was at the door
      himself, rushing back. He, too, had remembered. It was almost a collision,
      and nothing but their good Southern breeding, the way they took it, saved
      it from being like a rowdy farce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said simply and immediately. &ldquo;I am sorry to be so careless.
      It&rsquo;s for the twenty-seventh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was writing it down in the order-book. &ldquo;Very well. That is Wednesday
      of next week. You have given us more time than we need.&rdquo; She put complete,
      impersonal business into her tone; and this time he marched off in good
      order, leaving peace in the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not peace; quiet, merely; the girl at the counter now proceeded to
      grow indignant with me. We were alone together, we two; no young man, or
      any other business, occupied her or protected me. But if you suppose that
      she made war, or expressed rage by speaking, that is not it at all. From
      her counter in front to my table at the back she made her displeasure
      felt; she was inaudibly crushing; she did not do it even with her eye, she
      managed it&mdash;well, with her neck, somehow, and by the way she made her
      nose look in profile. Aunt Carola would have embraced her&mdash;and I
      should have liked to do so myself. She could not stand the idea of my
      having, after all these days of official reserve that she had placed
      between us, startled her into that rush to the door annihilated her
      dignity at a blow. So did I finish my sandwiches beneath her invisible but
      eloquent fire. What affair of mine was the cake? And what sort of
      impertinent, meddlesome person was I, shrieking out my suggestions to
      people with whom I had no acquaintance? These were the things that her
      nose and her neck said to me the whole length of the Exchange. I had
      nothing but my own weakness to thank; it was my interest in weddings that
      did it, made me forget my decorum, the public place, myself, everything,
      and plunge in. And I became more and more delighted over it as the girl
      continued to crush me. My day had been dull, my researches had not brought
      me a whit nearer royal blood; I looked at my little bill-of-fare, and then
      I stepped forward to the counter, adventurous, but polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like a slice, if you please, of Lady Baltimore,&rdquo; I said with
      extreme formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought she was going to burst; but after an interesting second she
      replied, &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; in her fit Regular Exchange tone; only, I thought it
      trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the table and she brought me the cake, and I had my first
      felicitous meeting with Lady Baltimore. Oh, my goodness! Did you ever
      taste it? It&rsquo;s all soft, and it&rsquo;s in layers, and it has nuts&mdash;but I
      can&rsquo;t write any more about it; my mouth waters too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted surprise caused me once more to speak aloud, and with my mouth
      full. &ldquo;But, dear me, this Is delicious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A choking ripple of laughter came from the counter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I who make
      them,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I thank you for the unintentional compliment.&rdquo; Then
      she walked straight back to my table. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she said,
      laughing still, and her delightful, insolent nose well up; &ldquo;how can I
      behave myself when a man goes on as you do?&rdquo; A nice white curly dog
      followed her, and she stroked his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your behavior is very agreeable to me,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll allow me to say that you&rsquo;re not invited to criticise it. I was
      decidedly put out with you for making me ridiculous. But you have admired
      my cake with such enthusiasm that you are forgiven. And&mdash;may I hope
      that you are getting on famously with the battle of Cowpens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frankly very much astonished that you should know about
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re just known all about in Kings Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wish that our miserable alphabet could in some way render the soft
      Southern accent which she gave to her words. But it cannot. I could easily
      misspell, if I chose; but how, even then, could I, for instance, make you
      hear her way of saying &ldquo;about&rdquo;? &ldquo;Aboot&rdquo; would magnify it; and besides, I
      decline to make ugly to the eye her quite special English, that was so
      charming to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kings Port just knows all about you,&rdquo; she repeated with a sweet and
      mocking laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind telling me how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She explained at once. &ldquo;This place is death to all incognitos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation, however, did not, on the instant, enlighten me. &ldquo;This?
      The Woman&rsquo;s Exchange, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure! Have you not heard ladies talking together here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I blankly repealed her words. &ldquo;Ladies talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;How dull of me! Ladies talking! Of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued. &ldquo;It was therefore widely known that you were consulting our
      South Carolina archives at the library&mdash;and then that notebook you
      bring marked you out the very first day. Why, two hours after your first
      lunch we just knew all about you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kings Port is ever ready to discuss strangers,&rdquo; she further explained.
      &ldquo;The Exchange has been going on five years, and the resident families have
      discussed each other so thoroughly here that everything is known;
      therefore a stranger is a perfect boon.&rdquo; Her gayety for a moment
      interrupted her, before she continued, always mocking and always sweet:
      &ldquo;Kings Port cannot boast intelligence offices for servants; but if you
      want to know the character and occupation of your friends, come to the
      Exchange!&rdquo; How I wish I could give you the raciness, the contagion, of her
      laughter! Who would have dreamed that behind her primness all this frolic
      lay in ambush? &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a plantation girl; it&rsquo;s my first
      week here, and I know every wicked deed everybody as done since 1812!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went back to her counter. It had been very merry; and as I was
      settling the small debt for my lunch I asked: &ldquo;Since this is the proper
      place for information, will you kindly tell me whose wedding that cake is
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was astonished. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? And I thought you were quite a clever
      Ya&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;Northerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me, since I know you&rsquo;re quite a clever Reb&mdash;I beg your
      pardon&mdash;Southerner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s his own! Couldn&rsquo;t you see that from his bashfulness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordering his own wedding cake?&rdquo; Amazement held me. But the door opened,
      one of the elderly ladies entered, the girl behind the counter stiffened
      to primness in a flash, and I went out into Royal Street as the curly
      dog&rsquo;s tail wagged his greeting to the newcomer.

    <h2>
      III: Kings Port Talks
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course I had at once left the letters of introduction which Aunt Carola
      had given me; but in my ignorance of Kings Port hours I had found
      everybody at dinner when I made my first round of calls between half-past
      three and five&mdash;an experience particularly regrettable, since I had
      hurried my own dinner on purpose, not then aware that the hours at my
      boarding-house were the custom of the whole town. (These hours even since
      my visit to Kings Port, are beginning to change. But such backsliding is
      much condemned.) Upon an afternoon some days later, having seen in the
      extra looking-glass, which I had been obliged to provide for myself, that
      the part in my back hair was perfect, I set forth again, better informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rang the first doorbell, another visitor came up the steps, a
      beautiful old lady in widow&rsquo;s dress, a cardcase in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you rung, sir?&rdquo; said she, in a manner at once gentle and voluminous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she pulled it again. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t always ring,&rdquo; she explained,
      &ldquo;unless one is accustomed to it, which you are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She addressed me with authority, exactly like Aunt Carola, and with even
      greater precision in her good English and good enunciation. Unlike the
      girl at the Exchange, she had no accent; her language was simply the
      perfection of educated utterance; it also was racy with the free
      censoriousness which civilized people of consequence are apt to exercise
      the world over. &ldquo;I was sorry to miss your visit,&rdquo; she began (she knew me,
      you see, perfectly); &ldquo;you will please to come again soon, and console me
      for my disappointment. I am Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, and my house is in
      Le Maire Street (Pronounced in Kings Port, Lammarree) as you have been so
      civil as to find out. And how does your Aunt Carola do in these
      contemptible times? You can tell her from me that vulgarization is
      descending, even upon Kings Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine that!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot imagine it because you don&rsquo;t know anything about it, young
      gentleman! The manners of some of our own young people will soon be as
      dishevelled as those in New York. Have you seen our town yet, or is it all
      books with you? You should not leave without a look at what is still left
      of us. I shall be happy if you will sit in my pew on Sunday morning. Your
      Northern shells did their best in the bombardment&mdash;did you say that
      you rang? I think you had better pull it again; all the way out; yes, like
      that&mdash;in the bombardment, but we have our old church still, in spite
      of you. Do you see the crack in that wall? The earthquake did it. You&rsquo;re
      spared earthquakes in the North, as you seem to be spared pretty much
      everything disastrous&mdash;except the prosperity that&rsquo;s going to ruin you
      all. We&rsquo;re better off with our poverty than you. Just ring the bell once
      more, and then we&rsquo;ll go. I fancy Julia&mdash;I fancy Mrs. Weguelin St.
      Michael&mdash;has run out to stare at the Northern steam yacht in the
      harbor. It would be just like her. This house is historic itself. Shabby
      enough now, to be sure! The great-aunt of my cousin, John Mayrant (who is
      going to be married next Wednesday, to such a brute of a girl, poor boy!),
      lived here in 1840, and made an answer to the Earl of Mainridge that put
      him in his place. She was our famous Kings Port wit, and at the reception
      which her father (my mother&rsquo;s uncle) gave the English visitor, he
      conducted himself as so many Englishmen seem to think they can in this
      country. Miss Beaufain (pronounced in Kings Port, Bowfayne), as she was
      then, asked the Earl how he liked America; and he replied, very well,
      except for the people, who were so vulgar. &lsquo;What can you expect?&rsquo; said
      Miss Beaufain; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re descended from the English.&rsquo; Mrs. St. Michael is
      out, and the servant has gone home. Slide this card under the door, with
      your own, and come away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took me with her, moving through the quiet South Place with a
      leisurely grace and dignity at which my spirit rejoiced; she was so
      beautiful, and so easy, and afraid of nothing and nobody! (This must be
      modified. I came later to suspect that they all stood in some dread of
      their own immediate families.)

      In the North, everybody is afraid of something: afraid of the legislature,
      afraid of the trusts, afraid of the strikes, afraid of what the papers
      will say, of what the neighbors will say, of what the cook will say; and
      most of all, and worst of all, afraid to be different from the general
      pattern, afraid to take a step or speak a syllable that shall cause them
      to be thought unlike the monotonous millions of their fellow-citizens; the
      land of the free living in ceaseless fear! Well, I was already afraid of
      Mrs. Gregory St. Michael. As we walked and she talked, I made one or two
      attempts at conversation, and speedily found that no such thing was the
      lady&rsquo;s intention: I was there to listen; and truly I could wish nothing
      more agreeable, in spite of my desire to hear further about next
      Wednesday&rsquo;s wedding and the brute of a girl. But to this subject Mrs. St.
      Michael did not return. We crossed Worship Street and Chancel Street, and
      were nearing the East Place where a cannon was being shown me, a cannon
      with a history and an inscription concerning the &ldquo;war for Southern
      independence, which I presume your prejudice calls the Rebellion,&rdquo; said my
      guide. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mrs. St. Michael now, coming round the corner. Well,
      Julia, could you read the yacht&rsquo;s name with your naked eye? And what&rsquo;s the
      name of the gambler who owns it? He&rsquo;s a gambler, or he couldn&rsquo;t own a
      yacht&mdash;unless his wife&rsquo;s a gambler&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well you&rsquo;re feeling to-day, Maria!&rdquo; said the other lady, with a
      gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I have been talking for twenty minutes.&rdquo; I was now presented
      to Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael, also old, also charming, in widow&rsquo;s dress no
      less in the bloom of age than Mrs. Gregory, but whiter and very
      diminutive. She shyly welcomed me to Kings Port. &ldquo;Take him home with you,
      Julia. We pulled your bell three times, and it&rsquo;s too damp for you to be
      out. Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory said to me, &ldquo;that you haven&rsquo;t told me a
      word about your Aunt Carola, and that I shall expect you to come and do
      it.&rdquo; She went slowly away from us, up the East Place, tall, graceful,
      sweeping into the distance like a ship. No haste about her dignified
      movement, no swinging of elbows, nothing of the present hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful girl she must have been!&rdquo; I murmured aloud,
      unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she was not a beauty in her youth,&rdquo; said my new guide in her shy
      voice, &ldquo;but always fluent, always a wit. Kings Port has at times thought
      her tongue too downright. We think that wit runs in her family, for young
      John Mayrant has it; and her first-cousin-once-removed put the Earl of
      Mainridge in his place at her father&rsquo;s ball in 1840. Miss Beaufain (as she
      was then) asked the Earl how he liked America; and he replied, very well,
      except for the people, who were so vulgar. &lsquo;What can you expect?&rsquo; said
      Miss Beaufain; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re descended from the English.&rsquo; I am very sorry for
      Maria&mdash;for Mrs. St. Michael&mdash;just at present. Her young cousin,
      John Mayrant, is making an alliance deeply vexatious to her. Do you happen
      to know Miss Hortense Rieppe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never heard of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? She has been North lately. I thought you might have met her. Her
      father takes her North, I believe, whenever any one will invite them. They
      have sometimes managed to make it extend through an unbroken year.
      Newport, I am credibly informed, greatly admires her. We in Kings Port
      have never (except John Mayrant, apparently) seen anything in her beauty,
      which Northerners find so exceptional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is her type?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider that she looks like a steel wasp. And she has the assurance to
      call herself a Kings Port girl. Her father calls himself a general, and it
      is repeated that he ran away at the battle of Chattanooga. I hope you will
      come to see me another day, when you can spare time from the battle of
      Cowpens. I am Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael, the other lady is Mrs. Gregory
      St. Michael. I wonder if you will keep us all straight?&rdquo; And smiling, the
      little lady, whose shy manner and voice I had found to veil as much spirit
      as her predecessor&rsquo;s, dismissed me and went up her steps, letting herself
      into her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy in question, the boy of the cake, John Mayrant, was coming out of
      the gate at which I next rang. The appearance of his boyish figure and
      well-carried head struck me anew, as it had at first; from his whole
      person one got at once a strangely romantic impression. He looked at me,
      made as if he would speak, but passed on. Probably he had been hearing as
      much about me as I had been hearing about him. At this house the black
      servant had not gone home for the night, and if the mistress had been out
      to take a look at the steam yacht, she had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; she said, presenting me to a supremely fine-looking old lady,
      more chiselled, more august, than even herself. I did not catch this
      lady&rsquo;s name, and she confined herself to a distant, though perhaps not
      unfriendly, greeting. She was sitting by a work-table, and she resumed
      some embroidery of exquisite appearance, while my hostess talked to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both wore their hair in a simple fashion to suit their years, which must
      have been seventy or more; both were dressed with the dignity that such
      years call for; and I may mention here that so were all the ladies above a
      certain age in this town of admirable old-fashioned propriety. In New
      York, in Boston, in Philadelphia, ladies of seventy won&rsquo;t be old ladies
      any more; they&rsquo;re unwilling to wear their years avowedly, in quiet dignity
      by their firesides; they bare their bosoms and gallop egregiously to the
      ball-rooms of the young; and so we lose a particular graciousness that
      Kings Port retains, a perspective of generations. We happen all at once,
      with no background, in a swirl of haste and similarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the many things which came home to me during the conversation that
      now began (so many more things came home than I can tell you!) was that
      Mrs. Gregory St. Michael&rsquo;s tongue was assuredly &ldquo;downright&rdquo; for Kings
      Port. This I had not at all taken in while she talked to me, and her
      friend&rsquo;s reference to it had left me somewhat at a loss. That better
      precision and choice of words which I have mentioned, and the manner in
      which she announced her opinions, had put me in mind of several fine
      ladles whom I had known in other parts of the world; but hers was an
      individual manner, I was soon to find, and by no means the Kings Port
      convention. This convention permitted, indeed, condemnations of one&rsquo;s
      neighbor no less sweeping, but it conveyed them in a phraseology far more
      restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot regret your coming to Kings Port,&rdquo; said my hostess, after we had
      talked for a little while, and I had complimented the balmy March weather
      and the wealth of blooming flowers; &ldquo;but I fear that Fanning is not a name
      that you will find here. It belongs to North Carolina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled and explained that North Carolina Fannings were useless to me.
      &ldquo;And, if I may be so bold, how well you are acquainted with my errand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cannot say that my hostess smiled, that would be too definite; but I can
      say that she did not permit herself to smile, and that she let me see this
      repression. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we are acquainted with your errand, though
      not with its motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat silent, thinking of the Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hostess now gave me her own account of why all things were known to all
      people in this town. &ldquo;The distances in your Northern cities are greater,
      and their population is much greater. There are but few of us in Kings
      Port.&rdquo; In these last words she plainly told me that those &ldquo;few&rdquo; desired no
      others. She next added: &ldquo;My nephew, John Mayrant, has spoken of you at
      some length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed. &ldquo;I had the pleasure to see and hear him order a wedding cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. From Eliza La Heu (pronounced Layhew), my niece; he is my nephew,
      she is my niece on the other side. My niece is a beginner at the Exchange.
      We hope that she will fulfil her duties there in a worthy manner. She
      comes from a family which is schooled to meet responsibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed again; again it seemed fitting. &ldquo;I had not, until now, known the
      charming girl&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hostess now bowed slightly. &ldquo;I am glad that you find her charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, also, are pleased with her. She is of good family&mdash;for the
      up-country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again our alphabet fails me. The peculiar shade of kindness, of
      recognition, of patronage, which my agreeable hostess (and all Kings Port
      ladies, I soon noticed) imparted to the word &ldquo;up-country&rdquo; cannot be
      conveyed except by the human voice&mdash;and only a Kings Port voice at
      that. It is a much lighter damnation than what they make of the phrase
      &ldquo;from Georgia,&rdquo; which I was soon to hear uttered by the lips of the lady.
      &ldquo;And so you know about his wedding cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam, I feel that I shall know about everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gray eyes looked at me quietly for a moment. &ldquo;That is possible. But
      although we may talk of ourselves to you, we scarcely expect you to talk
      of ourselves to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, my pertness had brought me this quite properly! And I received it
      properly. &ldquo;I should never dream&mdash;&rdquo; I hastened to say; &ldquo;even without
      your warning. I find I&rsquo;m expected to have seen the young lady of his
      choice,&rdquo; I now threw out. My accidental words proved as miraculous as the
      staff which once smote the rock. It was a stream, indeed, which now broke
      forth from her stony discretion. She began easily. &ldquo;It is evident that you
      have not seen Miss Rieppe by the manner in which you allude to her&mdash;although
      of course, in comparison with my age, she is a young girl.&rdquo; I think that
      this caused me to open my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disparity between her years and my nephew&rsquo;s is variously stated,&rdquo;
       continued the old lady. &ldquo;But since John&rsquo;s engagement we have all of us
      realized that love is truly blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not open my mouth any more; but my mind&rsquo;s mouth was wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hostess kept it so. &ldquo;Since John Mayrant was fifteen he has had many
      loves; and for myself, knowing him and believing in him as I do, I feel
      confident that he will make no connection distasteful to the family when
      he really comes to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time I gasped outright. &ldquo;But&mdash;the cake!&mdash;next Wednesday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made, with her small white hand, a slight and slighting gesture. &ldquo;The
      cake is not baked yet, and we shall see what we shall see.&rdquo; From this
      onward until the end a pinkness mounted in her pale, delicate cheeks, and
      deep, strong resentment burned beneath her discreetly expressed
      indiscretions. &ldquo;The cake is not baked, and I, at least, am not solicitous.
      I tell my cousin, Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, that she must not forget it
      was merely his phosphates. That girl would never have looked at John
      Mayrant had it not been for the rumor of his phosphates. I suppose some
      one has explained to you her pretensions of birth. Away from Kings Port
      she may pass for a native of this place, but they come from Georgia. It
      cannot be said that she has met with encouragement from us; she, however,
      easily recovers from such things. The present generation of young people
      in Kings Port has little enough to remind us of what we stood for in
      manners and customs, but we are not accountable for her, nor for her
      father. I believe that he is called a general. His conduct at Chattanooga
      was conspicuous for personal prudence. Both of them are skillful in never
      knowing poor people&mdash;but the Northerners they consort with must
      really be at a loss how to bestow their money. Of course, such Northerners
      cannot realize the difference between Kings Port and Georgia, and
      consequently they make much of her. Her features do undoubtedly possess
      beauty. A Newport woman&mdash;the new kind&mdash;has even taken her to
      Worth! And yet, after all, she has remained for John. We heard a great
      deal of her men, too. She took care of that, of course. John Mayrant
      actually followed her to Newport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help crying out, &ldquo;I thought he was so poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The phosphates,&rdquo; my hostess explained. &ldquo;They had been discovered on his
      land. And none of her New York men had come forward. So John rushed back
      happy.&rdquo; At this point a very singular look came over the face of my
      hostess, and she continued: &ldquo;There have been many false reports (and false
      hopes in consequence) based upon the phosphate discoveries. It was I who
      had to break it to him&mdash;what further investigation had revealed. Poor
      John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has, then, nothing?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His position in the Custom House, and a penny or two from his mother&rsquo;s
      fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the cake?&rdquo; I now once again reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hostess lifted her delicate hand and let it fall. Her resentment at the
      would-be intruder by marriage still mounted. &ldquo;Not even from that pair
      would I have believed such a thing possible!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and she went
      into a long, low, contemplative laugh, looking not at me, but at the fire.
      Our silent companion continued to embroider. &ldquo;That girl,&rdquo; my hostess
      resumed, &ldquo;and her discreditable father played on my nephew&rsquo;s youth and
      chivalry to the tune of&mdash;well, you have heard the tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t quite take it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They rattled their poverty at him until he offered and they
      accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must have stared grotesquely now. &ldquo;That&mdash;that&mdash;the cake&mdash;and
      that sort of thing&mdash;at his expense?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I shall be glad if you can find me anything that they have
      ever done at their own expense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I doubt if she would ever have permitted her speech such freedom had not
      the Rieppes been &ldquo;from Georgia&rdquo;; I am sure that it was anger&mdash;family
      anger, race anger&mdash;which had broken forth; and I think that her
      silent, severe sister scarcely approved of such breaking forth to me, a
      stranger. But indignation had worn her reticence thin, and I had happened
      to press upon the weak place. After my burst of exclamation I came back to
      it. &ldquo;So you think Miss Rieppe will get out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my nephew who will &lsquo;get out of it,&rsquo; as you express it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I totally misunderstood her. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I protested stupidly. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look
      like that. And it takes all meaning from the cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say cake to me again!&rdquo; said the lady, smiling at last. &ldquo;And&mdash;will
      you allow me to tell you that I do not need to have my nephew, John
      Mayrant, explained to me by any one? I merely meant to say that he, and
      not she, is the person who will make the lucky escape. Of course, he is
      honorable&mdash;a great deal too much so for his own good. It is a
      misfortune, nowadays, to be born a gentleman in America. But, as I told
      you, I am not solicitous. What she is counting on&mdash;because she thinks
      she understands true Kings Port honor, and does not in the least&mdash;is
      his renouncing her on account of the phosphates&mdash;the bad news, I
      mean. They could live on what he has&mdash;not at all in her way, though&mdash;and
      besides, after once offering his genuine, ardent, foolish love&mdash;for
      it was genuine enough at the time&mdash;John would never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped; but I took her up. &ldquo;Did I understand you to say that his love
      was genuine at the lime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he thinks it is now&mdash;insists it is now! That is just precisely
      what would make him&mdash;do you not see?&mdash;stick to his colors all
      the closer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;What a predicament!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But my hostess nodded easily. &ldquo;Oh, no. You will see. They will all see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose to take my leave; my visit, indeed, had been, for very interest,
      prolonged beyond the limits of formality&mdash;my hostess had attended
      quite thoroughly to my being entertained. And at this point the other, the
      more severe and elderly lady, made her contribution to my entertainment.
      She had kept silence, I now felt sure, because gossip was neither her
      habit nor to her liking. Possibly she may have also felt that her
      displeasure had been too manifest; at any rate, she spoke out of her
      silence in cold, yet rich, symmetrical tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, I understand, is your first visit to Kings Port?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid down her exquisite embroidery. &ldquo;It has been thought a place worth
      seeing. There is no town of such historic interest at the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing by my chair, I assured her that I did not think there could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you allude to my half-sister-in-law, Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael.
      It was at the house where she now lives that the famous Miss Beaufain (as
      she was then) put the Earl of Mainridge in his place, at the reception
      which her father gave the English visitor in 1840. The Earl conducted
      himself as so many Englishmen seem to think they can in this country; and
      on her asking him how he liked America, he replied, very well, except for
      the people, who were so vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What can you expect?&rsquo; said Miss Beaufain; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re descended from the
      English.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I suppose you will tell me that your Northern beauties can easily
      outmatch such wit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to disclaim any such pretension; and having expressed my
      appreciation of the anecdote, I moved to the door as the stately lady
      resumed her embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hostess had a last word for me. &ldquo;Do not let the cake worry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside the handsome old iron gate I looked at my watch and found that for
      this day I could spend no more time upon visiting.

      IV: THE GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER&mdash;I
    </h2>
    <p>
      I fear&mdash;no; to say one &ldquo;fears&rdquo; that one has stepped aside from the
      narrow path of duty, when one knows perfectly well that one has done so,
      is a ridiculous half-dodging of the truth; let me dismiss from my service
      such a cowardly circumlocution, and squarely say that I neglected the
      Cowpens during certain days which now followed. Nay, more; I totally
      deserted them. Although I feel quite sure that to discover one is a real
      king&rsquo;s descendant must bring an exultation of no mean order to the heart,
      there&rsquo;s no exultation whatever in failing to discover this, day after day.
      Mine is a nature which demands results, or at any rate signs of results
      coming sooner or later. Even the most abandoned fisherman requires a bite
      now and then; but my fishing for Fannings had not yet brought me one
      single nibble&mdash;and I gave up the sad sport for a while. The beautiful
      weather took me out of doors over the land, and also over the water, for I
      am a great lover of sailing; and I found a little cat-boat and a little
      negro, both of which suited me very well. I spent many delightful hours in
      their company among the deeps and shallows of these fair Southern waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indoors, also, I made most agreeable use of my time, in spite of one
      disappointment when, on the day following my visit to the ladies, I
      returned full of expectancy to lunch at the Woman&rsquo;s exchange, the girl
      behind the counter was not there. I found in her stead, it is true, a most
      polite lady, who provided me with chocolate and sandwiches that were just
      as good as their predecessors; but she was of advanced years, and little
      inclined to light conversation. Beyond telling me that Miss Eliza La Heu
      was indisposed, but not gravely so, and that she was not likely to be long
      away from her post of duty, this lady furnished me with scant information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I desired a great deal of information. To learn of an imminent wedding
      where the bridegroom attends to the cake, and is suspected of diminished
      eagerness for the bride, who is a steel wasp&mdash;that is not enough to
      learn of such nuptials. Therefore I fear&mdash;I mean, I know&mdash;that
      it was not wholly for the sake of telling Mrs. Gregory St. Michael about
      Aunt Carola that I repaired again to Le Maire Street and rang Mrs. St.
      Michael&rsquo;s door-bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at home, to be sure, but with her sat another visitor, the tall,
      severe lady who had embroidered and had not liked the freedom with which
      her sister had spoken to me about the wedding. There was not a bit of
      freedom to-day; the severe lady took care of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after some utterly unprofitable conversation, I managed to say in a
      casual voice, which I thought very well tuned for the purpose, &ldquo;What part
      of Georgia did you say that General Rieppe came from?&rdquo; the severe lady
      responded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that I mentioned him at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgia?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory St. Michael. &ldquo;I never heard that they came
      from Georgia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this revived my hopes. But the severe lady at once remarked to her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received a most agreeable letter from my sister in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This stopped Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, and dashed my hopes to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe lady continued to me:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister writes of witnessing a performance of the Lohengrin. Can you
      tell me if it is a composition of merit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that it was a composition of the highest merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is many years since I have heard an opera,&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;In my day
      the works of the Italians were much applauded. But I doubt if Mozart will
      be surpassed. I hope you admire the Nozze?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You will not need me to tell you that I came out of Mrs. Gregory St.
      Michael&rsquo;s house little wiser than I went in. My experience did not lead me
      to abandon all hope. I paid other visits to other ladies; but these
      answered my inquiries in much the same sort of way as had the lady who
      admired Mozart. They spoke delightfully of travel, books, people, and of
      the colonial renown of Kings Port and its leading families; but it is
      scarce an exaggeration to say that Mozart was as near the cake, the
      wedding, or the steel wasp as I came with any of them. By patience,
      however, and mostly at our boarding-house table, I gathered a certain
      knowledge, though small in amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the health of John Mayrant&rsquo;s mother, I learned, had allowed that lady
      to bring him up Herself, many follies might have been saved the youth. His
      aunt, Miss Eliza St. Michael, though a pattern of good intentions, was not
      always a pattern of wisdom. Moreover, how should a spinster bring up a boy
      fitly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Rieppes, father and daughter, I also learned a little more. They
      did not (most people believed) come from Georgia. Natchez and Mobile
      seemed to divide the responsibility of giving them to the world. It was
      quite certain the General had run away from Chattanooga. Nobody disputed
      this, or offered any other battle as the authentic one. Of late the
      Rieppes were seldom to be seen in Kings Port. Their house (if it had ever
      been their own property, which I heard hotly argued both ways) had been
      sold more than two years ago, and their recent brief sojourns in the town
      were generally beneath the roof of hospitable friends&mdash;people by the
      name of Cornerly, &ldquo;whom we do not know,&rdquo; as I was carefully informed by
      more than one member of the St. Michael family. The girl had disturbed a
      number of mothers whose sons were prone to slip out of the strict
      hereditary fold in directions where beauty or champagne was to be found;
      and the Cornerlys dined late, and had champagne. Miss Hortense had
      &ldquo;splurged it&rdquo; a good deal here, and the measure of her success with the
      male youth was the measure of her condemnation by their female elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the facts which I gathered from women and from the few men whom
      I saw in Kings Port. This town seemed to me almost as empty of men as if
      the Pied Piper had passed through here and lured them magically away to
      some distant country. It was on the happy day that saw Miss Eliza La Heu
      again providing me with sandwiches and chocolate that my knowledge of the
      wedding and the bride and groom began really to take some steps forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not I who, at my sequestered lunch at the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange, began
      the conversation the next time. That confection, &ldquo;Lady Baltimore,&rdquo; about
      which I was not to worry myself, had, as they say, &ldquo;broken the ice&rdquo;
       between the girl behind the counter and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has put it off!&rdquo; This, without any preliminaries, was her direct and
      stimulating news.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never was more grateful for the solitude of the Exchange, where I had,
      before this, noted and blessed an absence of lunch customers as prevailing
      as the trade winds; the people I saw there came to talk, not to purchase.
      Well, I was certainly henceforth coming for both!
    </p>
    <p>
      I eagerly plunged in with the obvious question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indefinitely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Only Wednesday week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will it keep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My ignorance diverted her. &ldquo;Lady Baltimore? Why, the idea!&rdquo; And she
      laughed at me from the immense distance that the South is from the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll have to pay for two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I wasn&rsquo;t going to make it till Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose that kind of thing would keep,&rdquo; I muttered rather
      vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her young spirits bubbled over. &ldquo;Which kind of thing? The wedding&mdash;or
      the cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This produced a moment of laughter on the part of us both; we giggled
      joyously together amid the silence and wares for sale, the painted cups,
      the embroidered souvenirs, the new food, and the old family &ldquo;pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So this delightful girl was a verbal skirmisher! Now nothing is more to my
      liking than the verbal skirmish, and therefore I began one immediately. &ldquo;I
      see you quite know,&rdquo; was the first light shot that I hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her retort to this was merely a very bland and inquiring stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now aimed a trifle nearer the mark. &ldquo;About him&mdash;her&mdash;it! Since
      you practically live in the Exchange, how can you exactly help yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her laughter came back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all, you know, so much later than 1812.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later! Why, a lot of it is to happen yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over the counter. &ldquo;Tell me what you know about it,&rdquo; she said
      with caressing insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;but probably they mean to have your education progress
      chronologically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can pick it up anywhere. We had to at the plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was from my table in the distant dim back of the room, where things
      stood lumpily under mosquito netting, that I told her my history. She made
      me go there to my lunch. She seemed to desire that our talk over the
      counter should not longer continue. And so, back there, over my chocolate
      and sandwiches, I brought out my gleaned and arranged knowledge which rang
      out across the distance, comically, like a lecture. She, at her counter,
      now and then busy with her ledger, received it with the attentive
      solemnity of a lecture. The ledger might have been notes that she was
      dutifully and improvingly taking. After I had finished she wrote on for a
      little while in silence. The curly white dog rose into sight, looked
      amiably and vaguely about, stretched himself, and sank to sleep again out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of such a young man?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I think of such a young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still pensive. &ldquo;Yes, yes, but then that is so simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had a short laugh. &ldquo;Oh, if you come to the simplicity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, seeming to be doing sums with her pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are always simple&mdash;when they&rsquo;re in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assented. &ldquo;And women&mdash;you&rsquo;ll agree?&mdash;are always simple when
      they&rsquo;re not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She finished her sums. &ldquo;Well, I think he&rsquo;s foolish!&rdquo; she frankly stated.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Aunt Josephine think so, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Josephine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Josephine St. Michael&mdash;my greet-aunt&mdash;the lady who
      embroidered. She brought me here from the plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it. But don&rsquo;t you think it is your turn now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken my turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not much. To say you think he&rsquo;s foolish isn&rsquo;t much. You&rsquo;ve seen him
      since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen him? Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here. Since the postponement. I take it he came himself about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he came. You don&rsquo;t suppose we discussed the reasons, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady, I suppose nothing, except that you certainly must
      have seen how he looked (he can blush, you know, handsomely), and that you
      may have some knowledge or some guess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some guess why it&rsquo;s not to be until Wednesday week? Of course he said
      why. Her poor, dear father, the General, isn&rsquo;t very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, indeed, must be an anxiety for Johnny,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led her to indulge in some more merriment. &ldquo;But he does,&rdquo; she then
      said, &ldquo;seem anxious about something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Then you admit it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She resorted again to the bland, inquiring stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he won&rsquo;t admit,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;even to his intimate Aunt, because
      he&rsquo;s so honorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly is simple,&rdquo; she commented, in soft and pensive tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some one,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;who could&mdash;not too directly, of
      course&mdash;suggest that to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I prefer men to be simple,&rdquo; she returned somewhat quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially when they&rsquo;re in love,&rdquo; I reminded her somewhat slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want some Lady Baltimore to-day?&rdquo; she inquired in the official
      Exchange tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose obediently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, I should have gone back to the
      battle of Cowpens long ago, and I&rsquo;ll just say this&mdash;since you asked
      me what I thought of him&mdash;that if he&rsquo;s descended from that John
      Mayrant who fought the Serapes under Paul Jones&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is!&rdquo; she broke in eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s not a name in South Carolina that I&rsquo;d rather have for my
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I intended that thrust to strike home, but she turned it off most
      competently. &ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t accept us because of our ancestors. That&rsquo;s
      how we&rsquo;ve been accepting ourselves, and only look where we are in the
      race!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said, as a parting attempt, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re not perfectly
      satisfied&mdash;all of you&mdash;as to where you are in the race!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t pretend anything!&rdquo; she flashed back.

    <h2>
      V: The Boy of the Cake
    </h2>
    <p>
      One is unthankful, I suppose, to call a day so dreary when one has lunched
      under the circumstances that I have attempted to indicate; the bright spot
      ought to shine over the whole. But you haven&rsquo;t an idea what a nightmare in
      the daytime Cowpens was beginning to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had thumbed and scanned hundreds of ancient pages, some of them
      manuscript; I had sat by ancient shelves upon hard chairs, I had sneezed
      with the ancient dust, and I had not put my finger upon a trace of the
      right Fanning. I should have given it up, left unexplored the territory
      that remained staring at me through the backs of unread volumes, had it
      not been for my Aunt Carola. To her I owed constancy and diligence, and so
      I kept at it; and the hermit hours I spent at Court and Chancel streets
      grew worse as I knew better what rarely good company was ready to receive
      me. This Kings Port, this little city of oblivion, held, shut in with its
      lavender and pressed-rose memories, a handful of people who were like that
      great society of the world, the high society of distinguished men and
      women who exist no more, but who touched history with a light hand, and
      left their mark upon it in a host of memoirs and letters that we read
      to-day with a starved and home-sick longing in the midst of our sullen
      welter of democracy. With its silent houses and gardens, its silent
      streets, its silent vistas of the blue water in the sunshine, this
      beautiful, sad place was winning my heart and making it ache. Nowhere else
      in America such charm, such character, such true elegance as here&mdash;and
      nowhere else such an overwhelming sense of finality!&mdash;the doom of a
      civilization founded upon a crime. And yet, how much has the ballot done
      for that race? Or, at least, how much has the ballot done for the majority
      of that race? And what way was it to meet this problem with the sudden
      sweeping folly of the Fifteenth Amendment? To fling the &ldquo;door of hope&rdquo;
       wide open before those within had learned the first steps of how to walk
      sagely through it! Ah, if it comes to blame, who goes scatheless in this
      heritage of error? I could have shaped (we all could, you know) a better
      scheme for the universe, a plan where we should not flourish at each
      other&rsquo;s expense, where the lion should be lying down with the lamb now,
      where good and evil should not be husband and wife, indissolubly married
      by a law of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such highly novel thoughts as these I descended the steps from my
      researches at the corner of Court and Chancel streets an hour earlier than
      my custom, because&mdash;well, I couldn&rsquo;t, that day, stand Cowpens for
      another minute. Up at the corner of Court and Worship the people were
      going decently into church; it was a sweet, gentle late Friday in Lent. I
      had intended keeping out-of-doors, to smell the roses in the gardens, to
      bask in the soft remnant of sunshine, to loiter and peep in through the
      Kings Port garden gates, up the silent walks to the silent verandas. But
      the slow stream of people took me, instead, into church with the deeply
      veiled ladies of Kings Port, hushed in their perpetual mourning for not
      only, I think, those husbands and brothers and sons whom the war had
      turned to dust forty years ago, but also for the Cause, the lost Cause,
      that died with them. I sat there among these Christians suckled in a creed
      outworn, envying them their well-regulated faith; it, too, was part of the
      town&rsquo;s repose and sweetness, together with the old-fashioned roses and the
      old-fashioned ladies. Men, also, were in the congregation&mdash;not many,
      to be sure, but all unanimously wearing that expression of remarkable
      virtue which seems always to visit, when he goes to church, the average
      good fellow who is no better than he should be. I became, myself, filled
      with this same decorous inconsistency, and was singing the hymn, when I
      caught sight of John Mayrant. What lady was he with? It was just this that
      most annoyingly I couldn&rsquo;t make out, because the unlucky disposition of
      things hid it. I caught myself craning my neck and singing the hymn
      simultaneously and with no difficulty, because all my childhood was in
      that hymn; I couldn&rsquo;t tell when I hadn&rsquo;t known words and music by heart.
      Who was she? I tried for a clear view when we sat down, and also, let me
      confess, when we knelt down; I saw even less of her so; and my hope at the
      end of the service was dashed by her slow but entire disappearance amid
      the engulfing exits of the other ladies. I followed where I imagined she
      had gone, out by a side door, into the beautiful graveyard; but among the
      flowers and monuments she was not, nor was he; and next I saw, through the
      iron gate, John Mayrant in the street, walking with his intimate aunt and
      her more severe sister, and Miss La Heu. I somewhat superfluously hastened
      to the gate and greeted them, to which they responded with polite,
      masterly discouragement. He, however, after taking off his hat to them,
      turned back, and I watched them pursuing their leisurely, reticent course
      toward the South Place. Why should the old ladies strike me as looking
      like a tremendously proper pair of conspirators? I was wondering this as I
      turned back among the tombs, when I perceived John Mayrant coming along
      one of the churchyard paths. His approach was made at right angles with
      that of another personage, the respectful negro custodian of the place.
      This dignitary was evidently hoping to lead me among the monuments, recite
      to me their old histories, and benefit by my consequent gratitude; he had
      even got so far as smiling and removing his hat when John Mayrant stopped
      him. The young man hailed the negro by his first name with that particular
      and affectionate superiority which few Northerners can understand and none
      can acquire, and which resembles nothing so much as the way in which you
      speak to your old dog who has loved you and followed you, because you have
      cared for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; John Mayrant said. &ldquo;I wish to show our relics to this
      gentleman myself&mdash;if he will permit me?&rdquo; This last was a question put
      to me with a courteous formality, a formality which a few minutes more
      were to see smashed to smithereens.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I should consider myself undeservedly privileged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of these people are my people,&rdquo; he said, beginning to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old custodian stood smiling, familiar, respectful, disappointed. &ldquo;Some
      of &lsquo;em my people, too, Mas&rsquo; John,&rdquo; he cannily observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put a little silver in his hand. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see a box somewhere,&rdquo; I said,
      &ldquo;with something on it about the restoration of the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something on it, but nothing in it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayrant; at which moderate
      pleasantry the custodian broke into extreme African merriment and ambled
      away. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; protested the Southerner, and I
      naturally claimed my stranger&rsquo;s right to pay my respects in this manner.
      Such was our introduction, agreeable and unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence then unexpectedly ensued and the formality fell colder than ever
      upon us. The custodian&rsquo;s departure had left us alone, looking at each
      other across all the unexpressed knowledge that each knew the other had.
      Mayrant had come impulsively back to me from his aunts, without stopping
      to think that we had never yet exchanged a word; both of us were now
      brought up short, and it was the cake that was speaking volubly in our
      self-conscious dumbness. It was only after this brief, deep gap of things
      unsaid that John Mayrant came to the surface again, and began a
      conversation of which, on both our parts, the first few steps were taken
      on the tiptoes of an archaic politeness; we trod convention like a
      polished French floor; you might have expected us, after such deliberate
      and graceful preliminaries, to dance a verbal minuet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, however, danced something quite different, and that conversation
      lasted during many days, and led us, like a road, up hill and down dale to
      a perfect acquaintance. No, not perfect, but delightful; to the end he
      never spoke to me of the matter most near him, and I but honor him the
      more for his reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course his first remark had to be about Kings Port and me; had he
      understood rightly that this was my first visit?
    </p>
    <p>
      My answer was equally traditional.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, next, correct that he should allude to the weather; and his
      reference was one of the two or three that it seems a stranger&rsquo;s destiny
      always to hear in a place new to him: he apologized for the weather&mdash;so
      cold a season had not, in his memory, been experienced in Kings Port; it
      was to the highest point exceptional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I exclaimed that it had been, to my Northern notions, delightfully mild
      for March. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I have always said that if March could
      be cut out of our Northern climate, as the core is cut out of an apple, I
      should be quite satisfied with eleven months, instead of twelve. I think
      it might prolong one&rsquo;s youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire of that season lighted in his eyes, but he still stepped upon
      polished convention. He assured me that the Southern September hurricane
      was more deplorable than any Northern March could be. &ldquo;Our zone should be
      called the Intemperate zone,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never in Kings Port,&rdquo; I protested; &ldquo;with your roses out-of-doors&mdash;and
      your ladies indoors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. &ldquo;You pay us a high compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled urbanely. &ldquo;If the truth is a compliment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our young ladies are roses,&rdquo; he now admitted with a delicate touch of
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your old ones! I never shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was pleasure in his face at this tribute, which, he could see, came
      from the heart. But, thus pictured to him, the old ladies brought a
      further idea quite plainly into his expression; and he announced it. &ldquo;Some
      of them are not without thorns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you give,&rdquo; I quickly replied, &ldquo;for anybody&mdash;man or woman&mdash;who
      could not, on an occasion, make themselves sharply felt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this he returned a full but somewhat absent-minded assent. He seemed to
      be reflecting that he himself didn&rsquo;t care to be the &ldquo;occasion&rdquo; upon which
      an old lady rose should try her thorns; and I was inclined to suspect that
      his intimate aunt had been giving him a wigging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, I stood ready to keep it up, this interchange of lofty civilities.
      I, too, could wear the courtly red-heels of eighteenth-century procedure,
      and for just as long as his Southern up-bringing inclined him to wear
      them; I hadn&rsquo;t known Aunt Carola for nothing! But we, as I have said, were
      not destined to dance any minuet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been moving, very gradually, and without any attention to our
      surroundings, to and fro in the beautiful sweet churchyard. Flowers were
      everywhere, growing, budding, blooming; color and perfume were parts of
      the very air, and beneath these pretty and ancient tombs, graven with old
      dates and honorable names, slept the men and women who had given Kings
      Port her high place is; in our history. I have never, in this country,
      seen any churchyard comparable to this one; happy, serene dead, to sleep
      amid such blossoms and consecration! Good taste prevailed here;
      distinguished men lay beneath memorial stones that came no higher than
      your waist or shoulder; there was a total absence of obscure grocers
      reposing under gigantic obelisks; to earn a monument here you must win a
      battle, or do, at any rate, something more than adulterate sugar and oil.
      The particular monument by which young John Mayrant and I found ourselves
      standing, when we reached the point about the ladies and the thorns, had a
      look of importance and it caught his eye, bringing him back to where we
      were. Upon his pointing to it, and before we had spoken or I had seen the
      name, I inquired eagerly: &ldquo;Not the lieutenant of the Bon Homme Richard?&rdquo;
       and then saw that Mayrant was not the name upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My knowledge of his gallant sea-fighting namesake visibly gratified him.
      &ldquo;I wish it were,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am descended from this man, too. He was
      a statesman, and some of his brilliant powers were inherited by his
      children&mdash;but they have not come so far down as me. In 1840, his
      daughter, Miss Beaufain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laid my hand right on his shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, John Mayrant!&rdquo; I
      cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me that. Last night I caught myself saying that
      instead of my prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, it killed the minuet dead; he sat flat down on the low stone coping
      that bordered the path to which we had wandered back&mdash;and I sat flat
      down opposite him. The venerable custodian, passing along a neighboring
      path, turned his head and stared at our noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, see those chillun goin&rsquo; on!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; John, don&rsquo;t you get
      too scandalous, tellin&rsquo; strangers &lsquo;bout the old famblies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayrant pointed to me. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s responsible, Daddy Ben. I&rsquo;m being just as
      good as gold. Honest injun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The custodian marched slowly on his way, shaking his head. &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; John he
      do go on,&rdquo; he repeated. His office was not alone the care and the showing
      off of the graveyard, but another duty, too, as native and peculiar to the
      soil as the very cotton and the rice: this loyal servitor cherished the
      honor of the &ldquo;old famblies,&rdquo; and chide their young descendants whenever he
      considered that they needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayrant now sat revived after his collapse of mirth, and he addressed me
      from his gravestone. &ldquo;Yes, I ought to have foreseen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foreseen&mdash;?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t at once catch the inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my aunts and cousins have been talking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Beaufain and the Earl of Mainridge! Well, but it&rsquo;s quite worth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing by heart!&rdquo; he broke in with new merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept on. &ldquo;Why not? They tell those things everywhere&mdash;where they&rsquo;re
      so lucky as to possess them! It&rsquo;s a flawless specimen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of 1840 repartee?&rdquo; He spoke with increasing pauses. &ldquo;Yes. We do at least
      possess that. And some wine of about the same date&mdash;and even
      considerably older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better for age,&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the blue eyes of Mayrant were far away and full of shadow. &ldquo;Poor Kings
      Port,&rdquo; he said very slowly and quietly. Then he looked at me with the
      steady look and the smile that one sometimes has when giving voice to a
      sorrowful conviction against which one has tried to struggle. &ldquo;Poor Kings
      Port,&rdquo; he affectionately repeated. His hand tapped lightly two or three
      times upon the gravestone upon which he was seated. &ldquo;Be honest and say
      that you think so, too,&rdquo; he demanded, always with his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how was I to agree aloud with what his silent hand had expressed?
      Those inaudible taps on the stone spoke clearly enough; they said: &ldquo;Here
      lies Kings Port, here lives Kings Port. Outside of this is our true death,
      on the vacant wharves, in the empty streets. All that we have left is the
      immortality which these historic names have won.&rdquo; How could I tell him
      that I thought so, too? Nor was I as sure of it then as he was. And
      besides, this was a young man whose spirit was almost surely, in
      suffering; ill fortune both material and of the heart, I seemed to
      suspect, had made him wounded and bitter in these immediate days; and the
      very suppression he was exercising hurt him the more deeply. So I replied,
      honestly, as he had asked: &ldquo;I hope you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you haven&rsquo;t been here long enough,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over us, gently, from somewhere across the gardens and the walls, came a
      noiseless water breeze, to which the roses moved and nodded among the
      tombs. They gave him a fanciful thought. &ldquo;Look at them! They belong to us,
      and they know it. They&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Yes; yes; yes,&rsquo; all day long. I don&rsquo;t
      know why on earth I&rsquo;m talking in this way to you!&rdquo; he broke off with
      vivacity. &ldquo;But you made me laugh so.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VI: In the Churchyard
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Then it was a good laugh, indeed!&rdquo; I cried heartily.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go back to our fine manners!&rdquo; he begged comically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
      satisfied each other that we have them! I feel so lonely; and my aunt just
      now&mdash;well, never mind about that. But you really must excuse us about
      Miss Beaufain, and all that sort of thing. I see it, because I&rsquo;m of the
      new generation, since the war, and&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve been to other places,
      too. But Aunt Eliza, and all of them, you know, can&rsquo;t see it. And I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have them, either! So I don&rsquo;t ever attempt to explain to them
      that the world has to go on. They&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t see the necessity!&rsquo; 
      When slavery stopped, they stopped, you see, just like a clock. Their hand
      points to 1865&mdash;it has never moved a minute since. And some day&rdquo;&mdash;his
      voice grew suddenly tender&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll go, one by one, to join the
      still older ones. And I shall miss them very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I did not speak, but watched the roses nodding and moving.
      Then I said: &ldquo;May I say that I shall miss them, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me. &ldquo;Miss our old Kings Port people?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t invite
      outsiders to do that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how it is?&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;It was the same thing once with
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same thing&mdash;in the North?&rdquo; His tone still held me off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same sort of dear old people&mdash;I mean charming, peppery, refined,
      courageous people; in Salem, in Boston, in New York, in every place that
      has been colonial, and has taken a hand in the game.&rdquo; And, as certain
      beloved memories of men and women rose in my mind, I continued: &ldquo;If you
      knew some of the Boston elder people as I have known them, you would warm
      with the same admiration that is filling me as I see your people of Kings
      Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But politics?&rdquo; the young Southerner slowly suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang slavery! Hang the war!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Of course, we had a family
      quarrel. But we were a family once, and a fine one, too! We knew each
      other, we visited each other, we wrote letters, sent presents, kept up
      relations; we, in short, coherently joined hands from one generation to
      another; the fibres of the sons tingled with the current from their
      fathers, back and back to the old beginnings, to Plymouth and Roanoke and
      Rip Van Winkle! It&rsquo;s all gone, all done, all over. You have to be a small,
      well-knit country for that sort of exquisite personal unitedness. There&rsquo;s
      nothing united about these States any more, except Standard Oil and
      discontent. We&rsquo;re no longer a small people living and dying for a great
      idea; we&rsquo;re a big people living and dying for money. And these ladies of
      yours&mdash;well, they have made me homesick for a national and a social
      past which I never saw, but which my old people knew. They&rsquo;re like
      legends, still living, still warm and with us. In their quiet clean-cut
      faces I seem to see a reflection of the old serene candlelight we all once
      talked and danced in&mdash;sconces, tall mirrors, candles burning inside
      glass globes to keep them from the moths and the draft that, of a warm
      evening, blew in through handsome mahogany doors; the good bright silver;
      the portraits by Copley and Gilbert Stuart; a young girl at a square
      piano, singing Moore&rsquo;s melodies&mdash;and Mr. Pinckney or Commodore Perry,
      perhaps, dropping in for a hot supper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Mayrant was smiling and looking at the graves. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it;
      that&rsquo;s all it,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;You do understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I had to finish my flight. &ldquo;Such quiet faces are gone now in the
      breathless, competing North: ground into oblivion between the clashing
      trades of the competing men and the clashing jewels and chandeliers of
      their competing wives&mdash;while yours have lingered on, spared by your
      very adversity. And that&rsquo;s why I shall miss your old people when they
      follow mine&mdash;because they&rsquo;re the last of their kind, the end of the
      chain, the bold original stock, the great race that made our glory grow
      and saw that it did grow through thick and thin: the good old native blood
      of independence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke as a man can always speak when he means it; and my listener&rsquo;s face
      showed that my words had gone where meant words always go&mdash;home to
      the heart. But he merely nodded at me. His nod, however, telling as it did
      of a quickly established accord between us, caused me to bring out to this
      new acquaintance still more of those thoughts which I condescend to expose
      to very few old ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you noticed,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or don&rsquo;t you feel it, away down here in
      your untainted isolation, the change, the great change, that has come over
      the American people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wasn&rsquo;t sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve lost their grip on patriotism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;We did that here in 1861.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! You left the Union, but you loved what you considered was your
      country, and you love it still. That&rsquo;s just my point, just my strange
      discovery in Kings Port. You retain the thing we&rsquo;ve lost. Our big men
      fifty years ago thought of the country, and what they could make it; our
      big men to-day think of the country and what they can make out of it.
      Rather different, don&rsquo;t you see? When I walk about in the North, I merely
      meet members of trusts or unions&mdash;according to the length of the
      individual&rsquo;s purse; when I walk about in Kings Port, I meet Americans.&mdash;Of
      course,&rdquo; I added, taking myself up, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too sweeping a statement. The
      right sort of American isn&rsquo;t extinct in the North by any means. But
      there&rsquo;s such a commercial deluge of the wrong sort, that the others
      sometimes seem to me sadly like a drop in the bucket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly understand it all,&rdquo; John Mayrant repeated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing to
      find you saying things that I have thought were my own private notions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. &ldquo;Oh, I fancy there are more than two of us in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the square piano and Mr. Pinckney,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose
      anybody had thought things like that, except myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I again said lightly, &ldquo;any American&mdash;any, that is, of the world&mdash;who
      has a colonial background for his family, has thought, probably, very much
      the same sort of things. Of course it would be all Greek or gibberish to
      the new people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took me up with animation. &ldquo;The new people! My goodness, sir, yes! Have
      you seen them? Have you seen Newport, for instance?&rdquo; His diction now (and
      I was to learn it was always in him a sign of heightening intensity) grew
      more and more like the formal speech of his ancestors. &ldquo;You have seen
      Newport?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But lately, sir? I knew we were behind the times down here, sir, but I
      had not imagined how much. Not by any means! Kings Port has a long road to
      go before she will consider marriage provincial and chastity obsolete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Mr. Mayrant! Well, I must tell you that it&rsquo;s not all quite so&mdash;so
      advanced&mdash;as that, you know. That&rsquo;s not the whole of Newport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to explain. &ldquo;Certainly not, sir! I would not insult the
      honorable families whom I had the pleasure to meet there, and to whom my
      name was known because they had retained their good position since the
      days when my great-uncle had a house and drove four horses there himself.
      I noticed three kinds of Newport, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Because I took letters; and some of the letters were to people who&mdash;who
      once had been, you know; it was sad to see the thing, sir, so plain
      against the glaring proximity of the other thing. And so you can divide
      Newport into those who leave to sell their old family pictures, those who
      have to buy their old family pictures, and the lucky few who need neither
      buy nor sell, who are neither goin&rsquo; down nor bobbing up, but who have kept
      their heads above the American tidal wave from the beginning and continue
      to do so. And I don&rsquo;t believe that there are any nicer people in the world
      than those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;When Near York does her best, what&rsquo;s better?&mdash;If
      only those best set the pace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only!&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the others who get into the papers, who
      dine the drunken dukes, and make poor chambermaids envious a thousand
      miles inland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There should be a high tariff on drunken dukes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get it!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Republican party whose
      daughters marry them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rocked with enjoyment where I sat; he was so refreshing. And I agreed
      with him so well. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re every bit as good as Miss Beaufain,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; oh, no! But I often think if we could only deport the negroes and
      Newport together to one of our distant islands, how happily our two chief
      problems would be solved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I still rocked. &ldquo;Newport would, indeed, enjoy your plan for it. Do go on!&rdquo;
       I entreated him But he had, for the moment, ceased; and I rose to stretch
      my legs and saunter among the old headstones and the wafted fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His aunt (or his cousin, or whichever of them it had been) was certainly
      right as to his inheriting a pleasant and pointed gift of speech; and a
      responsive audience helps us all. Such an audience I certainly was for
      young John Mayrant, yet beneath the animation that our talk had filled his
      eyes with lay (I seemed to see or feel) that other mood all the time, the
      mood which had caused the girl behind the counter to say to me that he was
      &ldquo;anxious about something.&rdquo; The unhappy youth, I was gradually to learn,
      was much more than that&mdash;he was in a tangle of anxieties. He talked
      to me as a sick man turns in bed from pain; the pain goes on, but the
      pillow for a while is cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there broke upon us a little interruption, so diverting, so utterly
      like the whole quaint tininess of Kings Port, that I should tell it to
      you, even if it did not bear directly upon the matter which was beginning
      so actively to concern me&mdash;the love difficulties of John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the letter-carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had come, from our secluded seats, round a corner, and so by the vestry
      door and down the walk beside the church, and as I read to myself the
      initials upon the stones wherewith the walk was paved, I drew near the
      half-open gateway upon Worship Street. The postman was descending the
      steps of the post-office opposite. He saw me through the gate and paused.
      He knew me, too! My face, easily marked out amid the resident faces he was
      familiar with, had at once caught his attention; very likely he, too, had
      by now learned that I was interested in the battle of Cowpens; but I did
      not ask him this. He crossed over and handed me a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he said most politely, &ldquo;takin&rsquo; it away down to Mistress
      Trevise&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re right here, sir. Northern mail eight hours late
      to-day,&rdquo; he added, and bowing, was gone upon his route.
    </p>
    <p>
      My home letter, from a man, an intimate running mate of mine, soon had my
      full attention, for on the second page it said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just got back from accompanying her to Baltimore. One of us went
      as far as Washington with her on the train. We gave her a dinner yesterday
      at the March Hare by way of farewell. She tried our new toboggan
      fire-escape on a bet. Clean from the attic, my boy. I imagine our native
      girls will rejoice at her departure. However, nobody&rsquo;s engaged to her, at
      least nobody here. How many may fancy themselves so elsewhere I can&rsquo;t say.
      Her name is Hortense Rieppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I must have been silent after finishing this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No bad news, I trust?&rdquo; John Mayrant inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him no; and presently we had resumed our seats in the quiet charm
      of the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now spoke with an intention. &ldquo;What a lot you seem to have seen and
      suffered of the advanced Newport!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intention wrought its due and immediate effect. &ldquo;Yes. There was no
      choice. I had gone to Newport upon&mdash;upon an urgent matter, which took
      me among those people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dwelt upon the pictures that came up in his mind. But he took me away
      again from the &ldquo;urgent matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; he resumed more briskly, &ldquo;fifteen or twenty&mdash;most amazing,
      sir!&mdash;young men, some of them not any older than I am, who had so
      many millions that they could easily&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, casting about for
      some expression adequate&mdash;&ldquo;could buy Kings Port and put it under a
      glass case in a museum&mdash;my aunts and all&mdash;and never know it!&rdquo; He
      livened with disrespectful mirth over his own picture of his aunts,
      purchased by millionaire steel or coal for the purposes of public
      edification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very good thing if they could be,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered a moment. &ldquo;My aunts? Under a glass case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;and with all deference be it said! They&rsquo;d be more
      invaluable, more instructive, than the classics of a thousand libraries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was prepared not to be pleased. &ldquo;May I ask to whom and for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you ought to see! You&rsquo;ve just been saying it yourself. They would
      teach our bulging automobilists, our unlicked boy cubs, our alcoholic
      girls who shout to waiters for &lsquo;high-balls&rsquo; on country club porches&mdash;they
      would teach these wallowing creatures, whose money has merely gilded their
      bristles, what American refinement once was. The manners we&rsquo;ve lost, the
      decencies we&rsquo;ve banished, the standards we&rsquo;ve lowered, their light is
      still flickering in this passing generation of yours. It&rsquo;s the last torch.
      That&rsquo;s why I wish it could, somehow, pass on the sacred fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want the sacred fire. They want the
      high-balls&mdash;and they have money enough to be drunk straight through
      the next world!&rdquo; He was thoughtful. &ldquo;They are the classics,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t see that he had gone back to my word. &ldquo;Roman Empire, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the others; the old people we&rsquo;re bidding good-by to. Roman Republic!
      Simple lives, gallant deeds, and one great uniting inspiration. Liberty
      winning her spurs. They were moulded under that, and they are our true
      American classics. Nothing like them will happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;our generation is uneasily living in a &lsquo;bad
      quarter-of-an-hour&rsquo;&mdash;good old childhood gone, good new manhood not
      yet come, and a state of chicken-pox between whiles.&rdquo; And on this I made
      to him a much-used and consoling quotation about the old order changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says that?&rdquo; he inquired; and upon my telling him, &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I hope so. But just now Uncle Sam &lsquo;aspires to descend.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at his counter-quotation. &ldquo;You know your classics, if you don&rsquo;t
      know Tennyson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, too, laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Aunt Eliza!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I didn&rsquo;t recognize Tennyson. My Aunt Eliza educated me&mdash;and she
      thinks Tennyson about the only poet worth reading since&mdash;well, since
      Byron and Sir Walter at the very latest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither she nor Sir Walter come down to modern poetry&mdash;or to
      alcoholic girls.&rdquo; His tone, on these last words, changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, as when he had said &ldquo;an urgent matter,&rdquo; I seemed to feel hovering
      above us what must be his ceaseless preoccupation; and I wondered if he
      had found, upon visiting Newport, Miss Hortense sitting and calling for
      &ldquo;high-balls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him a lead. &ldquo;The worst of it is that a girl who would like to
      behave herself decently finds that propriety puts her out of the running.
      The men flock off to the other kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was following me with watching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;what an anxious Newport parent does on
      finding her girl on the brink of being a failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that she scolds her like the dickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing so ineffectual! She makes her keep up with the others, you
      know. Makes her do things she&rsquo;d rather not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High-balls, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything, my friend; anything to keep up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a comic suggestion. &ldquo;Driven to drink by her mother! Well, it&rsquo;s, at
      any rate, a new cause for old effects.&rdquo; He paused. It seemed strangely to
      bring to him some sort of relief. &ldquo;That would explain a great deal,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he thus explaining to himself his lady-love, or rather certain Newport
      aspects of her which had, so to speak, jarred upon his Kings Port notions
      of what a lady might properly do? I sat on my gravestone with my wonder,
      and my now-dawning desire to help him (if improbably I could), to get him
      out of it, if he were really in it; and he sat on his gravestone opposite,
      with the path between us, and the little noiseless breeze rustling the
      white irises, and bearing hither and thither the soft perfume of the
      roses. His boy face, lean, high-strung, brooding, was full of suppressed
      contentions. I made myself, during our silence, state his possible
      problem: &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t love her any more, he won&rsquo;t admit this to himself; he
      intends to go through with it, and he&rsquo;s catching at any justification of
      what he has seen in her that has chilled him, so that he may, poor wretch!
      coax back his lost illusion.&rdquo; Well, if that was it, what in the world
      could I, or anybody, do about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      His next remark was transparent enough. &ldquo;Do you approve of young ladies
      smoking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I met his question with another: &ldquo;What reasons can be urged against it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was quick. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t mind it?&rdquo; There was actual hope in the way
      he rushed at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo; (As a matter of fact I do mind
      it; but it seemed best not to say so to him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell off again. &ldquo;I certainly saw very nice people doing it up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I filled this out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see very nice people doing it everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in Kings Port! At least, not my sort of people!&rdquo; He stiffly
      proclaimed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to draw him out. &ldquo;But is there, after all, any valid objection to
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was off on a preceding speculation. &ldquo;A mother or any parent,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;might encourage the daughter to smoke, too. And the girl might take
      it up so as not to be thought peculiar where she was, and then she might
      drop it very gladly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I became specific. &ldquo;Drop it, you mean, when she came to a place where
      doing it would be thought&mdash;well, in bad style?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or for the better reason,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that she didn&rsquo;t really like it
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much you don&rsquo;t &lsquo;really like it&rsquo; yourself!&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he was slow. &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;why need they? Are not their
      lips more innocent than ours? Is not the association somewhat&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;the association is, I think you&rsquo;ll have
      to agree, scarcely of my making!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;And, as you say, very nice people do it
      everywhere. But not here. Have you ever noticed,&rdquo; he now inquired with
      continued transparency, &ldquo;how much harder they are on each other than we
      are on them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;ve noticed that.&rdquo; I surmised it was this sort of thing he had
      earlier choked himself off from telling me in his unfinished complaint
      about his aunt; but I was to learn later that on this occasion it was upon
      the poor boy himself and not on the smoking habits of Miss Rieppe, that
      his aunt had heavily descended. I also reflected that if cigarettes were
      the only thing he deprecated in the lady of his choice, the lost illusion
      might be coaxed back. The trouble was that deprecated something fairly
      distant from cigarettes. The cake was my quite sufficient trouble; it
      stuck in my throat worse than the probably magnified gossip I had heard;
      this, for the present, I could manage to swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came out now with a personal note. &ldquo;I suppose you think I&rsquo;m a ninny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in the wildest dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but too innocent for a man, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be an insult,&rdquo; I declared laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For I&rsquo;m not innocent in the least. You&rsquo;ll find we&rsquo;re all men here, just
      as much as any men in the North you could pick out. South Carolina has
      never lacked sporting blood, sir. But in Newport&mdash;well, sir, we
      gentlemen down here, when we wish a certain atmosphere and all that, have
      always been accustomed to seek the demi-monde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was with us until the women changed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women, sir?&rdquo; He was innocent!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;ladies,&rsquo; as you Southerners so chivalrously continue to style them.
      The rich new fashionable ladies became so desperate in their competition
      for men&rsquo;s allegiance that they&mdash;well, some of them would, in the
      point of conversation, greatly scandalize the smart demi-monde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;Yes. I heard men say things in drawing-rooms to ladies that a
      gentleman here would have been taken out and shot for. And don&rsquo;t you agree
      with me, sir, that good taste itself should be a sort of religion? I don&rsquo;t
      mean to say anything sacrilegious, but it seems to me that even if one has
      ceased to believe some parts of the Bible, even if one does not always
      obey the Ten Commandments, one is bound, not as a believer but as a
      gentleman, to remember the difference between grossness and refinement,
      between excess and restraint&mdash;that one can have and keep just as the
      pagan Greeks did, a moral elegance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He astonished me, this ardent, ideal, troubled boy; so innocent regarding
      the glaring facts of our new prosperity, so finely penetrating as to some
      of the mysteries of the soul. But he was of old Huguenot blood, and of
      careful and gentle upbringing; and it was delightful to find such a young
      man left upon our American soil untainted by the present fashionable
      idolatries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bow to your creed of &lsquo;moral elegance,&rsquo;&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;It never dies. It has
      outlasted all the mobs and all the religions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seemed to think,&rdquo; he continued, pursuing his Newport train of
      thought, &ldquo;that to prove you were a dead game sport you must behave like&mdash;behave
      like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a herd of swine,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was merry. &ldquo;Ah, if they only would&mdash;completely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave so. Rush over a steep place into the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat in the quiet relish of his Scriptural idea, and the western crimson
      and the twilight began to come and mingle with the perfumes. John
      Mayrant&rsquo;s face changed from its vivacity to a sort of pensive wistfulness,
      which, for all the dash and spirit in his delicate features, was somehow
      the final thing one got from the boy&rsquo;s expression. It was as though the
      noble memories of his race looked out of his eyes, seeking new chances for
      distinction, and found instead a soil laid waste, an empty fatherland, a
      people benumbed past rousing. Had he not said, &ldquo;Poor Kings Port!&rdquo; as he
      tapped the gravestone? Moral elegance could scarcely permit a sigh more
      direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that you believe it never dies,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;And I am glad to
      find somebody to&mdash;talk to, you know. My friends here are everything
      friends and gentlemen should be, but they don&rsquo;t&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s
      because they have not had my special experiences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat waiting for the boy to go on with it. How plainly he was telling me
      of his &ldquo;special experiences&rdquo;! He and his creed were not merely in revolt
      against the herd of swine; there would be nothing special in that; I had
      met people before who were that; but he was tied by honor, and soon to be
      tied by the formidable nuptial knot, to a specimen devotee of the cult. He
      shouldn&rsquo;t marry her if he really did not want to, and I could stop it! But
      how was I to begin spinning the first faint web of plan how I might stop
      it, unless he came right out with the whole thing? I didn&rsquo;t believe he was
      the man to do that ever, even under the loosening inspiration of drink. In
      wine lies truth, no doubt; but within him, was not moral elegance the
      bottom truth that would, even in his cups, keep him a gentleman, and
      control all such revelations? He might smash the glasses, but he would not
      speak of his misgivings as to Hortense Rieppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began again, &ldquo;Nor do I believe that a really nice girl would continue
      to think as those few do, if she once got safe away from them. Why, my
      dear sir,&rdquo; he stretched out his hand in emphasis, &ldquo;you do not have to do
      anything untimely and extreme if you are in good earnest a dead game
      sport. The time comes, and you meet the occasion as the duck swims. There
      was one of them&mdash;the right kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;you&rsquo;re leaning against her headstone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little incongruity made us both laugh, but it was only for the
      instant. The tender mood of the evening, and all that we had said,
      sustained the quiet and almost grave undertone of our conference. My own
      quite unconscious act of rising from the grave and standing before him on
      the path to listen brought back to us our harmonious pensiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was born in Kings Port, but educated in Europe. I don&rsquo;t suppose until
      the time came that she ever did anything harder than speak French, or play
      the piano, or ride a horse. She had wealth and so had her husband. He was
      killed in the war, and so were two of her sons. The third was too young to
      go. Their fortune was swept away, but the plantation was there, and the
      negroes were proud to remain faithful to the family. She took hold of the
      plantation, she walked the rice-banks in high boots. She had an overseer,
      who, it was told her, would possibly take her life by poison or by
      violence. She nevertheless lived in that lonely spot with no protector
      except her pistol and some directions about antidotes. She dismissed him
      when she had proved he was cheating her; she made the planting pay as well
      as any man did after the war; she educated her last son, got him into the
      navy, and then, one evening, walking the river-banks too late, she caught
      the fever and died. You will understand she went with one step from
      cherished ease to single-handed battle with life, a delicately nurtured
      lady, with no preparation for her trials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except moral elegance,&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was the point, sir! To see her you would never have guessed it!
      She kept her burdens from the sight of all. She wore tribulation as if it
      were a flower in her bosom. We children always looked forward to her
      coming, because she was so gay and delightful to us, telling us stories of
      the old times&mdash;old rides when the country was wild, old journeys with
      the family and servants to the Hot Springs before the steam cars were
      invented, old adventures, with the battle of New Orleans or a famous duel
      in them&mdash;the sort of stories that begin with (for you seem to know
      something of it yourself, sir) &lsquo;Your grandfather, my dear John, the year
      that he was twenty, got himself into serious embarrassments through paying
      his attentions to two reigning beauties at once.&rsquo; She was full of stories
      which began in that sort of pleasant way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;When a person like that dies, an impoverishment falls upon us;
      the texture of life seems thinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed! I know what you mean&mdash;to lose the people one has
      always seen from the cradle. Well, she has gone away, she has taken her
      memories out of the world, the old times, the old stories. Nobody, except
      a little nutshell of people here, knows or cares anything about her any
      more; and soon even the nutshell will be empty.&rdquo; He paused, and then, as
      if brushing aside his churchyard mood, he translated into his changed
      thought another classic quotation: &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t dawdle over the &lsquo;tears of
      things&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s Nature&rsquo;s law. Only, when I think of the rice-banks and the
      boots and the pistol, I wonder if the Newport ladies, for all their
      high-balls, could do any better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crimson had faded, the twilight was altogether come, but the little
      noiseless breeze was blowing still; and as we left the quiet tombs behind
      us, and gained Worship Street, I could not help looking back where slept
      that older Kings Port about which I had heard and had said so much. Over
      the graves I saw the roses, nodding and moving, as if in acquiescent
      revery.

      VII: The Girl Behind the Counter&mdash;II
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of them is idealizing?&rdquo; This was the question that I asked myself,
      next morning, in my boarding-house, as I dressed for breakfast; the next
      morning is&mdash;at least I have always found it so&mdash;an excellent
      time for searching questions; and to-day I had waked up no longer beneath
      the strong, gentle spell of the churchyard. A bright sun was shining over
      the eastern waters of the town, I could see from my upper veranda the
      thousand flashes of the waves; the steam yacht rode placidly and
      competently among them, while a coastwise steamer was sailing by her, out
      to sea, to Savannah, or New York; the general world was going on, and&mdash;which
      of them was idealizing? It mightn&rsquo;t be so bad, after all. Hadn&rsquo;t I,
      perhaps, over-sentimentalized to myself the case of John Mayrant? Hadn&rsquo;t I
      imagined for him ever so much more anxiety than the boy actually felt? For
      people can idealize down just as readily as they can idealize up. Of Miss
      Hortense Rieppe I had now two partial portraits&mdash;one by the
      displeased aunts, the other by their chivalric nephew; in both she held
      between her experienced lips, a cigarette; there the similarity ceased.
      And then, there was the toboggan fire-escape. Well, I must meet the living
      original before I could decide whether (for me, at any rate) she was the
      &ldquo;brute&rdquo; as seen by the eyes of Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, or the &ldquo;really
      nice girl&rdquo; who was going to marry John Mayrant on Wednesday week. Just at
      this point my thoughts brought up hard again at the cake. No; I couldn&rsquo;t
      swallow that any better this morning than yesterday afternoon! Allow the
      gentleman to pay for the feast! Better to have omitted all feast; nothing
      simpler, and it would have been at least dignified, even if arid. But
      then, there was the lady (a cousin or an aunt&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t remember
      which this morning) who had told me she wasn&rsquo;t solicitous. What did she
      mean by that? And she had looked quite queer when she spoke about the
      phosphates. Oh, yes, to be sure, she was his intimate aunt! Where, by the
      way, was Miss Rieppe?
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I had eaten my breakfast and walked up Worship Street to the
      post-office I was full of it all again; my searching thoughts hadn&rsquo;t
      simplified a single point. I always called for my mail at the post-office,
      because I got it sooner; it didn&rsquo;t come to the boarding-house before I had
      departed on my quest for royal blood, whereas, this way, I simply got my
      letters at the corner of Court and Worship streets and walked diagonally
      across and down Court a few steps to my researches, which I could vary and
      alleviate by reading and answering news from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from Aunt Carola that I heard to-day. Only a little of what she
      said will interest you. There had been a delightful meeting of the
      Selected Salic Scions. The Baltimore Chapter had paid her Chapter a visit.
      Three ladies and one very highly connected young gentleman had come&mdash;an
      encouragingly full and enthusiastic meeting. They had lunched upon cocoa,
      sherry, and croquettes, after which all had been more than glad to listen
      to a paper read by a descendant of Edward the Third and the young
      gentleman, a descendant of Catherine of Aragon, had recited a beautiful
      original poem, entitled &ldquo;My Queen Grandmother.&rdquo; Aunt Carola regretted that
      I could not have had the pleasure and the benefit of this meeting, the
      young gentleman had turned out to be, also, a refined and tasteful
      musician, playing, upon the piano a favorite gavotte of Louis the
      Thirteenth &ldquo;And while you are in Kings Port,&rdquo; my aunt said; &ldquo;I expect you
      to profit by associating with the survivors of our good American society&mdash;people
      such as one could once meet everywhere when I was young, but who have been
      destroyed by the invasion of the proletariat. You are in the last citadel
      of good-breeding. By the way, find out, if you can, if any of the Bombo
      connection are extant; as through them I should like, if possible, to
      establish a chapter of the Scions in South Carolina. Have you, met a Miss
      Rieppe, a decidedly striking young woman, who says she is from Kings Port,
      and who recently passed through here with a very common man dancing
      attendance on her? He owns the Hermana, and she is said to be engaged to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This wasn&rsquo;t as good as meeting Miss Rieppe myself; but the new angle at
      which I got her from my Aunt was distinctly a contribution toward the
      young woman&rsquo;s likeness; I felt that I should know her at sight, if ever
      she came within seeing distance. And it would be entertaining to find that
      she was a Bombo; but that could wait; what couldn&rsquo;t wait was the Hermana.
      I postponed the Fannings, hurried by the door where they waited for me,
      and, coming to the end of Court Street, turned to the right and sought
      among the wharves the nearest vista that could give me a view of the
      harbor. Between the silent walls of commerce desolated, and by the empty
      windows from which Prosperity once looked out, I threaded my way to a
      point upon the town&rsquo;s eastern edge. Yes, that was the steam yacht&rsquo;s name:
      the Hermana. I didn&rsquo;t make it out myself, she lay a trifle too far from
      shore; but I could read from a little fluttering pennant that her owner
      was not on board; and from the second loafer whom I questioned I learned,
      besides her name, that she had come from New York here to meet her owner,
      whose name he did not know and whose arrival was still indefinite. This
      was not very much to find out; but it was so much more than I had found
      out about the Fannings that, although I now faithfully returned to my
      researches, and sat over open books until noon, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you a word
      of what I read. Where was Miss Rieppe, and where was the owner of the
      Hermana? Also, precisely how ill was the hero of Chattanooga, her poor
      dear father?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Exchange I opened the door upon a conversation which, in
      consequence, broke off abruptly; but this much I came in for:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but the slightest bruise above his eye. The other one is in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the severe lady who said this; I mean that lady who, among all the
      severe ones I had met, seemed capable of the highest exercise of this
      quality, although she had not exercised it in my presence. She looked, in
      her veil and her black street dress, as aloof, and as coldly scornful of
      the present day, as she had seemed when sitting over her embroidery; but
      it was not of 1818, or even 1840, that she had been talking just now: it
      was this morning that somebody was bruised, somebody was in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handsome lady acknowledged my salutation completely, but not
      encouragingly, and then, on the threshold, exchanged these parting
      sentences with the girl behind the counter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will have to shake hands. He was not very willing, but he listened
      to me. Of course, the chastisement was right&mdash;but it does not affect
      my opinion of his keeping on with the position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Aunt Josephine!&rdquo; the girl agreed. &ldquo;I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t. Did
      you say it was his right eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His left.&rdquo; Miss Josephine St. Michael inclined her head once more to me
      and went out of the Exchange. I retired to my usual table, and the girl
      read in my manner, quite correctly, the feelings which I had not supposed
      I had allowed to be evident. She said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Josephine always makes strangers think she&rsquo;s displeased with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied like the young ass which I constantly tell myself I have ceased
      to be: &ldquo;Oh, displeasure is as much notice as one is entitled to from Miss
      St. Michael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed with her delightful sweet mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, you&rsquo;re huffed! Now don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re not. But you mustn&rsquo;t
      be. When you know her, you&rsquo;ll know that that awful manner means Aunt
      Josephine is just being shy. Why, even I&rsquo;m not afraid of her George
      Washington glances any more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to have your courage.&rdquo; Over my chocolate
      and sandwiches I sat in curiosity discreditable, but natural. Who was in
      bed&mdash;who would have to shake hands? And why had they stopped talking
      when I came in? Of course, I found myself hoping that John Mayrant had put
      the owner of the Hermana in bed at the slight cost of a bruise above his
      left eye. I wondered if the cake was again countermanded, and I started
      upon that line. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have to-day, if you please, another slice of
      that Lady Baltimore.&rdquo; And I made ready for another verbal skirmish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry! It&rsquo;s a little stale to-day. You can have the last slice, if
      you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I will.&rdquo; She brought it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so very stale,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;How long since it has been made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the same you&rsquo;ve been having. You&rsquo;re its only patron just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no. There&rsquo;s Mr. Mayrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a week yet, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the wedding was on yet. Still, John might have smashed the owner of the
      Hermana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him lately?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something special in the way she looked. &ldquo;Not to-day. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in the forenoon. He has his duties and I have mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a little pause, and then, &ldquo;What do you think of the President?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The President?&rdquo; I was at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid you would take his view&mdash;the Northern view,&rdquo; she
      mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave me, suddenly, her meaning. &ldquo;Oh, the President of the United
      States! How you do change the subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were upon me, burning with sectional indignation, but she seemed
      to be thinking too much to speak. Now, here was a topic that I had
      avoided, and she had plumped it at me. Very well; she should have my view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean that a gentleman cannot invite any respectable member of any
      race he pleases to dine privately in his house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His house!&rdquo; She was glowing now with it. &ldquo;I think he is&mdash;I think he
      is&mdash;to have one of them&mdash;and even if he likes it, not to
      remember&mdash;cannot speak about him!&rdquo; she wound up &ldquo;I should say
      unbecoming things.&rdquo; She had walked out, during these words, from behind
      the counter and as she stood there in the middle of the long room you
      might have thought she was about to lead a cavalry charge. Then,
      admirably, she put it all under, and spoke on with perfect self-control.
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t somebody explain it to him? If I knew him, I would go to him
      myself, and I would say, Mr. President, we need not discuss our different
      tastes as to dinner company. Nor need we discuss how much you benefit the
      colored race by an act which makes every member of it immediately think
      that he is fit to dine with any king in the world. But you are staying in
      a house which is partly our house, ours, the South&rsquo;s, for we, too, pay
      taxes, you know. And since you also know our deep feeling&mdash;you may
      even call it a prejudice, if it so pleases you&mdash;do you not think
      that, so long as you are residing in that house, you should not
      gratuitously shock our deep feeling?&rdquo; She swept a magnificent low curtsy
      at the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Miss La Heu!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;you put it so that it&rsquo;s rather hard
      to answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it strikes you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did it make them all think they were going to dine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds of thousands. It was proof to them that they were as good as
      anybody&mdash;just as good, without reading or writing or anything. The
      very next day some of the laziest and dirtiest where we live had a new
      strut, like the monkey when you put a red flannel cap on him&mdash;only
      the monkey doesn&rsquo;t push ladies off the sidewalk. And that state of mind,
      you know,&rdquo; said Miss La Heu, softening down from wrath to her roguish
      laugh, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t the right state of mind for racial progress! But I wasn&rsquo;t
      thinking of this. You know he has appointed one of them to office here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light entered my brain: John Mayrant had a position at the Custom House!
      John Mayrant was subordinate to the President&rsquo;s appointee! She hadn&rsquo;t
      changed the subject so violently, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came squarely at it. &ldquo;And so you wish him to resign his position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I was ahead of her this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chief of Customs?&rdquo; she wonderingly murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      I brought her up with me now. &ldquo;Did Miss Josephine St. Michael say it was
      over his left eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl instantly looked everything she thought. &ldquo;I believe you were
      present!&rdquo; This was her highly comprehensive exclamation, accompanied also
      by a blush as splendidly young as John Mayrant had been while he so
      stammeringly brought out his wishes concerning the cake. I at once decided
      to deceive her utterly, and therefore I spoke the exact truth: &ldquo;No, I
      wasn&rsquo;t present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did their work, my true words; the false impression flowed out of
      them as smoothly as California claret from a French bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder who told you?&rdquo; my victim remarked. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t really
      matter. Everybody is bound to know it. You surely were the last person
      with him in the churchyard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; I admitted again with splendidly mendacious veracity. &ldquo;How we
      do find each other out in Kings Port!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not by any means the least of the delights which I took in the
      company of this charming girl that sometimes she was too much for me, and
      sometimes I was too much for her. It was, of course, just the accident of
      our ages; in a very few years she would catch up, would pass, would always
      be too much for me. Well, to-day it was happily my turn; I wasn&rsquo;t going to
      finish lunch without knowing all she, at any rate, could tell me about the
      left eye and the man in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty years ago,&rdquo; I now, with ingenuity, remarked, &ldquo;I suppose it would
      have been pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She assented. &ldquo;And I like that better&mdash;don&rsquo;t you&mdash;for
      gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you mean that fists are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she finished for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; I maintained, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think that there ought to be some
      correspondence, some proportion, between the gravity of the cause and the
      gravity of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the coal-heavers take to their fists!&rdquo; she scornfully cried. &ldquo;People
      of our class can&rsquo;t descend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;then you give the coal-heavers the palm for
      discrimination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, perfectly! Your coal-heaver kills for some offenses, while for
      lighter ones he&mdash;gets a bruise over the left eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t meet it, you don&rsquo;t meet it! What is an insult ever but an
      insult?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we in the North notice certain degrees&mdash;insolence, impudence,
      impertinence, liberties, rudeness&mdash;all different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up my phrase with a sudden odd quietness. &ldquo;You in the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. We have, alas! to expect and allow for rudeness sometimes, even
      in our chosen few, and for liberties in their chosen few; it&rsquo;s only the
      hotel clerk and the head waiter from whom we usually get impudence; while
      insolence is the chronic condition of the Wall Street rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You in the North!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And so your Northern eyes can&rsquo;t see it,
      after all!&rdquo; At these words my intelligence sailed into a great blank,
      while she continued: &ldquo;Frankly&mdash;and forgive me for saying it&mdash;I
      was hoping that you were one Northerner who would see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But see what?&rdquo; I barked in my despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not help me. &ldquo;If I had been a man, nothing could have insulted me
      more than that. And that&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she regretfully finished.
      &ldquo;It seems so strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat in the midst of my great blank, while her handsome eyes rested upon
      me. In them was that look of a certain inquiry and a certain remoteness
      with which one pauses, in a museum, before some specimen of the
      cave-dwelling man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You comprehend so much,&rdquo; she meditated slowly, aloud; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been such
      an agreeable disappointment, because your point of view is so often the
      same as ours.&rdquo; She was still surveying me with the specimen expression,
      when it suddenly left her. &ldquo;Do you mean to sit there and tell me,&rdquo; she
      broke out, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t have resented it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; my mind lamentably said to itself, inside. Of what may have been
      the exterior that I presented to her, sitting over my slice of Lady
      Baltimore, I can form no impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put yourself in his place,&rdquo; the girl continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I gasped, &ldquo;that is always so easy to say and so hard to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My remark proved not a happy one. She made a brief, cold pause over it,
      and then, as she wheeled round from me, back to the counter: &ldquo;No
      Southerner would let pass such an affront.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was final. She regained her usual place, she resumed her ledger; the
      curly dog, who had come out to hear our conversation, went in again; I was
      disgraced. Not only with the profile of her short, belligerent nose, but
      with the chilly way in which she made her pencil move over the ledger, she
      told me plainly that my self-respect had failed to meet her tests. This
      was what my remarkable ingenuity had achieved for me. I swallowed the last
      crumbs of Lady Baltimore, and went forward to settle the account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m scarcely entitled to ask for a fresh one to-morrow,&rdquo; I
      ventured. &ldquo;I am so fond of this cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her officialness met me adequately. &ldquo;Certainly the public is entitled to
      whatever we print upon our bill-of-fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this was going to be too bad! Henceforth I was to rank merely as &ldquo;the
      public,&rdquo; no matter how much Lady Baltimore I should lunch upon! A happy
      thought seized me, and I spoke out instantly on the strength of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss La Heu, I&rsquo;ve a confession to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But upon this beginning of mine the inauspicious door opened and young
      John Mayrant came in. It was all right about his left eye; anybody could
      see that bruise!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, hearty, but somewhat disconcerted. &ldquo;To think of
      finding you here! You&rsquo;re going? But I&rsquo;ll see you later?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You know where I work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. I&rsquo;ll come. We&rsquo;ve all sorts of things more to say, haven&rsquo;t
      we? We&mdash;good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did I hear, as I gained the street, something being said about the
      General, and the state of his health?

      You may imagine in what state of wondering I went out of that place, and
      how little I could now do away with my curiosity. By the droll looks and
      head-turnings which followed me from strangers that passed me by in the
      street, I was made aware that I must be talking aloud to myself, and the
      words which I had evidently uttered were these: &ldquo;But who in the world can
      he have smashed up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, beneath the public stare and smile I kept the rest of my
      thoughts to myself; yet they so possessed and took me from my
      surroundings, that presently, while crossing Royal Street, I was nearly
      run down by an electric car. Nor did even this serve to disperse my
      preoccupation; my walk back to Court and Chancel streets is as if it had
      not been; I can remember nothing about it, and the first account that I
      took of external objects was to find myself sitting in my accustomed chair
      in the Library, with the accustomed row of books about the battle of
      Cowpens waiting on the table in front of me. How long we had thus been
      facing each other, the books and I, I&rsquo;ve not a notion. And with such
      mysterious machinery are we human beings filled&mdash;machinery that is in
      motion all the while, whether we are aware of it or not&mdash;that now,
      with some part of my mind, and with my pencil assisting, I composed
      several stanzas to my kingly ancestor, the goal of my fruitless search;
      and yet during the whole process of my metrical exercise I was really
      thinking and wondering about John Mayrant, his battles and his loves.

          ODE ON INTIMATIONS OF ROYALTY

          I sing to thee, thou Great Unknown,
          Who canst connect me with a throne
          Through uncle, cousin, aunt, or sister,
          But not, I trust, through bar sinister.

      Such was the frivolous opening of my poem, which, as it progressed, grew
      even less edifying; I have quoted this fragment merely to show you how
      little reverence for the Selected Salic Scions was by this time left in my
      spirit, and not because the verses themselves are in the least
      meritorious; they should serve as a model for no serious-minded singer,
      and they afford a striking instance of that volatile mood, not to say that
      inclination to ribaldry, which will at seasons crop out in me, do what I
      will. It is my hope that age may help me to subdue this, although I have
      observed it in some very old men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not send my poem to Aunt Carola, but I wrote her a letter, even
      there and then, couched in terms which I believe were altogether
      respectful. I deplored my lack of success in discovering the link that was
      missing between me and king&rsquo;s blood; I intimated my conviction that
      further effort on my part would still be met with failure; and I renounced
      with fitting expressions of disappointment my candidateship for the Scions
      thanking Aunt Carola for her generosity, by which I must now no longer
      profit. I added that I should remain in Kings Port for the present, as I
      was finding the climate of decided benefit to my health, and the courtesy
      of the people an education in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever pain at missing the glory of becoming a Scion may have lingered
      with me after this was much assuaged in a few days by my reading an
      article in a New York paper, which gave an account of a meeting of my
      Aunt&rsquo;s Society, held in that city. My attention was attracted to this
      article by the prominent heading given to it: THEY WORE THEIR CROWNS. This
      in very conspicuous Roman capitals, caused me to sit up. There must have
      been truth in some of it, because the food eaten by the Scions was
      mentioned as consisting of sandwiches, sherry and croquettes; yet I think
      that the statement that the members present addressed each other according
      to the royal families from which they severally traced descent, as, for
      example, Brother Guelph and Sister Plantagenet, can scarce have beers
      aught but an exaggeration; nevertheless, the article brought me undeniable
      consolation for my disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing my letter to Aunt Carola I should have hastened out to
      post it and escape from Cowpens, had I not remembered that John Mayrant
      had more or less promised to meet me here. Now, there was but a slender
      chance that he boy would speak to me on the subject of his late encounter;
      this I must learn from other sources; but he might speak to me about
      something that would open a way for my hostile preparations against Miss
      Rieppe. So far he had not touched upon his impending marriage in any way,
      but this reserve concerning a fact generally known among the people whom I
      was seeing could hardly go on long without becoming ridiculous. If he
      should shun mention of it to-day, I would take this as a plain sign that
      he did not look forward to it with the enthusiasm which a lover ought to
      feel for his approaching bliss; and on such silence from him I would
      begin, if I could, to undermine his intention of keeping an engagement of
      the heart when the heart no longer entered into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my thoughts continued to be busied over this lover and his concerns,
      I noticed the works of William Shakespeare close beside me upon a shelf;
      and although it was with no special purpose in mind that I took out one of
      the volumes and sat down with it to wait for John Mayrant, in a little
      while an inspiration came to me from its pages, so that I was more anxious
      than ever the boy should not fail to meet me here in the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the bruise on his forehead that had perturbed his manner just now
      when he entered the Exchange? No, this was not likely to be the reason,
      since he had been full as much embarrassed that first day of my seeing him
      there, when he had given his order for Lady Baltimore so lamely that the
      girl behind the counter had come to his aid. And what could it have been
      that he had begun to tell her to-day as I was leaving the place? Was the
      making of that cake again to be postponed on account of the General&rsquo;s
      precarious health? And what had been the nature of the insult which young
      John Mayrant had punished and was now commanded to shake hands over? Could
      it in truth be the owner of the Hermana whom he had thrashed so well as to
      lay him up in bed? That incident had damaged two people at least, the
      unknown vanquished combatant in his bodily welfare, and me in my character
      as an upstanding man in the fierce feminine estimation of Miss La Heu; but
      this injury it was my intention to set right; my confession to the girl
      behind the counter was merely delayed. As I sat with Shakespeare open in
      my lap, I added to my store of reasoning one little new straw of argument
      in favor of my opinion that John Mayrant was no longer at ease or happy
      about his love affair. I had never before met any young man in whose
      manner nature was so finely tempered with good bringing-up; forwardness
      and shyness were alike absent from him, and his bearing had a sort of
      polished unconsciousness as far removed from raw diffidence as it was from
      raw conceit; it was altogether a rare and charming address in a youth of
      such true youthfulness, but it had failed him upon two occasions which I
      have already mentioned. Both times that he had come to the Exchange he had
      stumbled in his usually prompt speech, lost his habitual ease, and
      betrayed, in short, all the signs of being disconcerted. The matter seemed
      suddenly quite plain to me: it was the nature of his errands to the
      Exchange. The first time he had been ordering the cake for his own
      wedding, and to-day it was something about the wedding again. Evidently
      the high mettle of his delicacy and breeding made him painfully conscious
      of the view which others must take of the part that Miss Rieppe was
      playing in all this&mdash;a view from which it was out of his power to
      shield her; and it was this consciousness that destroyed his composure.
      From what I was soon to learn of his fine and unmoved disregard for
      unfavorable opinion when he felt his course to be the right one, I know
      that it was no thought at all of his own scarcely heroic role during these
      days, but only the perception that outsiders must detect in his affianced
      lady some of those very same qualities which had chilled his too
      precipitate passion for her, and left him alone, without romance, without
      family sympathy, without social acclamations, with nothing indeed save his
      high-strung notion of honor to help him bravely face the wedding march.
      How appalling must the wedding march sound to a waiting bridegroom who
      sees the bride, that he no longer looks at except with distaste and
      estrangement, coming nearer and nearer to him up the aisle! A funeral
      march would be gayer than that music, I should think! The thought came to
      me to break out bluntly and say to him: &ldquo;Countermand the cake! She&rsquo;s only
      playing with you while that yachtsman is making up his mind.&rdquo; But there
      could be but one outcome of such advice to John Mayrant: two people,
      instead of one, would be in bed suffering from contusions. As I mused on
      the boy and his attractive and appealing character, I became more rejoiced
      than ever that he had thrashed somebody, I cared not very much who nor yet
      very much why, so long as such thrashing had been thorough, which seemed
      quite evidently and happily the case. He stood now in my eyes, in some way
      that is too obscure for me to be able to explain to you, saved from some
      reproach whose subtlety likewise eludes my powers of analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already five minutes after three o&rsquo;clock, my dinner hour, when he
      at length appeared in the Library; and possibly I put some reproach into
      my greeting: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you walk along with me to Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s?&rdquo; (That was
      my boarding house.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not get away from the Custom House sooner,&rdquo; he explained; and
      into his eyes there came for a moment that look of unrest and
      preoccupation which I had observed at times while we had discussed Newport
      and alcoholic girls. The two subjects seemed certainly far enough apart!
      But he immediately began upon a conversation briskly enough&mdash;so
      briskly that I suspected at once he had got his subject ready in advance;
      he didn&rsquo;t want me to speak first, lest I turn the talk into channels
      embarrassing, such as bruised foreheads or wedding cake. Well, this should
      not prevent me from dropping in his cup the wholesome bitters which I had
      prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir! Well, sir!&rdquo; such was his hearty preface. &ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;re
      feeling ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never when I read Shakespeare,&rdquo; I answered restoring the plume to its
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the title. &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the unsuitable love affairs that was prevented in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Bottom and Titania&mdash;and Romeo and Juliet were not prevented in
      time. They had their bliss once and to the full, and died before they
      caused each other anything but ecstasy. No weariness of routine, no tears
      of disenchantment; complete love, completely realized&mdash;and finis!
      It&rsquo;s the happiest ending of all the plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me hard. &ldquo;Sometimes I believe you&rsquo;re ironic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at him. &ldquo;A sign of the highest civilization, then. But please to
      think of Juliet after ten years of Romeo and his pin-headed intelligence
      and his preordained infidelities. Do you imagine that her predecessor,
      Rosamond, would have had no successors? Juliet would have been compelled
      to divorce Romeo, if only for the children&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children!&rdquo; cried John Mayrant. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s for their sake deserted
      women abstain from divorce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juliet would see deeper than such mothers. She could not have her little
      sons and daughters grow up and comprehend their father&rsquo;s absences, and see
      their mother&rsquo;s submission to his returns for such discovery would scorch
      the marrow of any hearts they had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, as we came out of the Library, he made an astonishing rejoinder,
      and one which I cannot in the least account for: &ldquo;South Carolina does not
      allow divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should think,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;that all you people here would be
      doubly careful as to what manner of husbands and wives you chose for
      yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a remark was sailing, you may say, almost within three points of the
      wind; and his own accidental allusion to Romeo had brought it about with
      an aptness and a celerity which were better for my purpose than anything I
      had privately developed from the text of Bottom and Titania; none the
      less, however, did I intend to press into my service that fond couple also
      as basis for a moral, in spite of the sharp turn which those last words of
      mine now caused him at once to give to our conversation. His quick
      reversion to the beginning of the talk seemed like a dodging of remarks
      that hit too near home for him to relish hearing pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he resumed with the same initial briskness, &ldquo;I was ashamed if
      you were not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t make out what impropriety we have jointly committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the views you expressed about our country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! When we sat on the gravestones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about it to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to him as we slowly walked toward Worship Street. &ldquo;Did you say
      anything then that you would take back now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered, wrinkling his forehead. &ldquo;Well, but all the same, didn&rsquo;t we
      give the present hour a pretty black eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The present hour deserves a black eye, and two of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He surveyed me squarely. &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re a pessimist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the first trashy thing I&rsquo;ve heard you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! At least admit you&rsquo;re scarcely an optimist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Optimist! Pessimist! Why, you&rsquo;re talking just like a newspaper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t compare a gentleman to a newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then keep your vocabulary clean of bargain-counter words. A while ago the
      journalists had a furious run upon the adjective &lsquo;un-American.&rsquo; Anybody or
      anything that displeased them was &lsquo;un-American.&rsquo; They ran it into the
      ground, and in its place they have lately set up &lsquo;pessimist,&rsquo; which
      certainly has a threatening appearance. They don&rsquo;t know its meaning, and
      in their mouths it merely signifies that what a man says snakes them feel
      personally uncomfortable. The word has become a dusty rag of slang. The
      arrested burglar very likely calls the policeman a pessimist; and,
      speaking reverently and with no intention to shock you, the scribes and
      Pharisees would undoubtedly have called Christ a pessimist when He called
      them hypocrites, had they been acquainted with the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more my remarks drew from the boy an unexpected rejoinder. We had
      turned into Worship Street, and, as we passed the churchyard, he stopped
      and laid his hand upon the railing of the pate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t shock me,&rdquo; he said; and then: &ldquo;But you would shock my aunts.&rdquo;
       He paused, gazing into the churchyard, before he continued more slowly:
      &ldquo;And so should I&mdash;if they knew it&mdash;shock them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they knew what?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand indicated a sculptured crucifix near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe everything still?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he looked at me, I suppose that he read negation in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more can I,&rdquo; he murmured. Again he looked in among the tombstones and
      flowers, where the old custodian saw us and took off his hat. &ldquo;Howdy,
      Daddy Ben!&rdquo; John Mayrant returned pleasantly, and then resuming to me: &ldquo;No
      more can I believe everything.&rdquo; Then he gave a brief, comical laugh. &ldquo;And
      I hope my aunts won&rsquo;t find that out! They would think me gone to perdition
      indeed. But I always go to church here&rdquo; (he pointed to the quiet building,
      which, for all its modest size and simplicity, had a stately and
      inexpressible charm), &ldquo;because I like to kneel where my mother said her
      prayers, you know.&rdquo; He flushed a little over this confidence into which he
      had fallen, but he continued: &ldquo;I like the words of the service, too, and I
      don&rsquo;t ask myself over-curiously what I do believe; but there&rsquo;s a permanent
      something within us&mdash;a Greater Self&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A permanent something,&rdquo; I assented, &ldquo;which has created all the religions
      all over the earth from the beginning, and of which Christianity itself is
      merely one of the present temples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made an exclamation at my word &ldquo;present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think anything in this world is final?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; he began, somewhat at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you found out yet that human nature is the one indestructible
      reality that we know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; he began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we have the &lsquo;latest thing&rsquo; all the time, and never the ultimate
      thing, never, never? The latest thing in women&rsquo;s hats is that huge-brimmed
      affair with the veil as voluminous as a double-bed mosquito netting. That
      hat will look improbable next spring. The latest thing in science is
      radium. Radium has exploded the conservation of energy theory&mdash;turned
      it into a last year&rsquo;s hat. Answer me, if Christianity is the same as when
      it wore among its savage ornaments a devil with horns and a flaming Hell!
      Forever and forever the human race reaches out its hand and shapes some
      system, some creed, some government, and declares: &lsquo;This is at length the
      final thing, the cure-all,&rsquo; and lo and behold, something flowing and
      eternal in the race itself presently splits the creed and the government
      to pieces! Truth is a very marvelous thing. We feel it; it can fill our
      eyes with tears, our hearts with joy, it can make us die for it; but once
      our human lips attempt to formulate and thus imprison it, it becomes a
      lie. You cannot shut truth up in any words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it shall prevail!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed with a sort of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything prevails,&rdquo; I answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;But Jacob got Esau&rsquo;s inheritance by a mean
      trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob was punished for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did that help Esau much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a pessimist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because I see Jacob and Esau to-day, alive and kicking in Wall
      Street, Washington, Newport, everywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no optimist, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m blind in neither eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give us credit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what we&rsquo;ve accomplished since Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Printing, steam, and electricity, for instance? They spread the Bible and
      the yellow journal with equal velocity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean science. Take our institutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve accomplished hospitals and the stock market&mdash;a pretty
      even set-off between God and the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take a high view of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a low one. I don&rsquo;t play ostrich with any of the staring permanences
      of human nature. We&rsquo;re just as noble to-day as David was sometimes, and
      just as bestial to-day as David was sometimes, and we&rsquo;ve every possibility
      inside us all the time, whether we paint our naked skins, or wear steel
      armor or starched shirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe good is the guiding power in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, John Mayrant! Good and evil draw us on like a span of horses,
      sometimes like a tandem, taking turns in the lead. Order has melted into
      disorder, and disorder into new order&mdash;how many times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But better each time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you know, who never lived in any age but your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know we have a higher ideal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we? The Greek was taught to love his neighbor as himself. He gave
      his great teacher a cup of poison. We gave ours the cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he looked away from me into the sweet old churchyard. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      answer you, but I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought me to gayety. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unanswerable, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still stared at the graves. &ldquo;Those people in there didn&rsquo;t think all
      these uncomfortable things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! no! They belonged in the first volume of the history of our national
      soul, before the bloom was off us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd notion! And pray what volume are we in now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that momentous picnic, the Spanish War!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that took the bloom off us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t. It merely waked Europe up to the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our battleships, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our steel rails, our gold coffers, our roaring affluence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our very accurate shooting!&rdquo; he insisted; for he was a Southerner,
      and man&rsquo;s gallantry appealed to him more than man&rsquo;s industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed. &ldquo;Yes, indeed! We may say that the Spanish War closed our first
      volume with a bang. And now in the second we bid good-by to the virgin
      wilderness, for it&rsquo;s explored; to the Indian, for he&rsquo;s conquered; to the
      pioneer, for he&rsquo;s dead; we&rsquo;ve finished our wild, romantic adolescence and
      we find ourselves a recognized world power of eighty million people, and
      of general commercial endlessness, and playtime over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think, John Mayrant now asserted, &ldquo;that it is going too far to say the
      bloom is off us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll find snow in the woods away into April and May. The
      freedom-loving American, the embattled farmer, is not yet extinct in the
      far recesses. But the great cities grow like a creeping paralysis over
      freedom, and the man from the country is walking into them all the time
      because the poor, restless fellow believes wealth awaits him on their
      pavements. And when he doesn&rsquo;t go to them, they come to him. The Wall
      Street bucket-shop goes fishing in the woods with wires a thousand miles
      long; and so we exchange the solid trailblazing enterprise of Volume One
      for Volume Two&rsquo;s electric unrest. In Volume One our wagon was hitched to
      the star of liberty. Capital and labor have cut the traces. The labor
      union forbids the workingman to labor as his own virile energy and skill
      prompt him. If he disobeys, he is expelled and called a &lsquo;scab.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t let
      us call ourselves the land of the free while such things go on. We&rsquo;re all
      thinking a deal too much about our pockets nowadays. Eternal vigilance
      cannot watch liberty and the ticker at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John Mayrant, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not thinking about our pockets in Kings
      Port, because&rdquo; (and here there came into his voice and face that sudden
      humor which made him so delightful)&mdash;&ldquo;because we haven&rsquo;t got any
      pockets to think of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought me down to cheerfulness from my flight among the cold clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued: &ldquo;Any more lamentations, Mr. Jeremiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who begin to call names, John Mayrant&mdash;but never mind! I could
      lament you sick if I chose to go on about our corporations and corruption
      that I see with my pessimistic eye; but the other eye sees the American
      man himself&mdash;the type that our eighty millions on the whole melt into
      and to which my heart warms each time I land again from more polished and
      colder shores&mdash;my optimistic eye sees that American dealing
      adequately with these political diseases. For stronger even than his
      kindness, his ability, and his dishonesty is his self-preservation. He&rsquo;s
      going to stand up for the &lsquo;open shop&rsquo; and sit down on the &lsquo;trust&rsquo;; and I
      assure you that I don&rsquo;t in the least resemble the Evening Post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of inquiry was in John Mayrant&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The New York Evening Post,&rdquo; I repeated with surprise. Still the inquiry
      of his face remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fortunate youth!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;To have escaped the New York Evening
      Post!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so heinous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!... well!... how exactly describe it?... make you see it?... It&rsquo;s
      partially tongue-tied, a sad victim of its own excesses. Habitual
      over-indulgence in blaming has given it a painful stutter when attempting
      praise; it&rsquo;s the sprucely written sheet of the supercilious; it&rsquo;s the
      after-dinner pill of the American who prefers Europe; it&rsquo;s our Republic&rsquo;s
      common scold, the Xantippe of journalism, the paper without a country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paper without a country! That&rsquo;s very good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;ll tell you something much better, but it is not mine. A clever
      New Yorker said that what with The Sun&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;what with The Sun making vice so attractive in the morning and the
      Post making virtue so odious in the evening, it was very hard for a man to
      be good in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I should subscribe to The Sun,&rdquo; said John Mayrant. He took his
      hand from the church-gate railing, and we had turned to stroll down
      Worship Street when he was unexpectedly addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes, while John Mayrant and I had been talking, I had grown
      aware, without taking any definite note of it, that the old custodian of
      the churchyard, Daddy Ben, had come slowly near us from the distant corner
      of his demesne, where he had been (to all appearances) engaged in some
      trifling activity among the flowers&mdash;perhaps picking off the faded
      blossoms. It now came home to me that the venerable negro had really been,
      in a surreptitious way, watching John Mayrant, and waiting for something&mdash;either
      for the right moment to utter what he now uttered, or his own delayed
      decision to utter it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; John!&rdquo; he called quite softly. His tone was fairly padded with
      caution, and I saw that in the pause which followed, his eye shot a swift
      look at the bruise on Mayrant&rsquo;s forehead, and another look, equally swift,
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Daddy Ben, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The custodian shunted close to the gate which separated him from us. &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; 
      John, I speck de President he dun&rsquo; know de cullud people like we knows
      &lsquo;um, else he nebber bin &lsquo;pint dat ar boss in de Cussum House, no, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this effort he wiped his forehead and breathed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment, the effort brought immediately a stern change over
      John Mayrant&rsquo;s face; then he answered in the kindest tones, &ldquo;Thank you,
      Daddy Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer interpreted for me the whole thing, which otherwise would have
      been obscure enough: the old man held it to be an indignity that his young
      &ldquo;Mas&rsquo; John&rdquo; should, by the President&rsquo;s act, find himself the subordinate
      of a member of the black race, and he had just now, in his perspiring
      effort, expressed his sympathy! Why he had chosen this particular moment
      (after quite obvious debate with himself) I did not see until somewhat
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now left us standing at the gate; and it was not for some moments that
      John Mayrant spoke again, evidently closing, for our two selves, this
      delicate subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we had not got into that second volume of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not progressive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? Better grow old gracefully!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Qui no pas l&rsquo;esprit de son age
          De son age a tout le malheur.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m personally not growing old, just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither is the United States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s too easy for sick or worthless people to survive
      nowadays. They are clotting up our square miles very fast. Philanthropists
      don&rsquo;t seem to remember that you can beget children a great deal faster
      than you can educate them; and at this rate I believe universal suffrage
      will kill us off before our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not believe it! We are going to find out that universal suffrage is
      like the appendix&mdash;useful at an early stage of the race&rsquo;s evolution
      but to-day merely a threat to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought this over. &ldquo;But a surgical operation is pretty serious, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be done by absorption. Why, you&rsquo;ve begun it yourselves, and so has
      Massachusetts. The appendix will be removed, black and white&mdash;and I
      shouldn&rsquo;t much fear surgery. We&rsquo;re not nearly civilized enough yet to have
      lost the power Of recuperation, and in spite of our express-train speed, I
      doubt if we shall travel from crudity to rottenness without a pause at
      maturity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the old, old story,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; is there anything new under the sun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gloomy. &ldquo;Nothing, I suppose.&rdquo; Then the gloom lightened. &ldquo;Nothing
      new under the sun&mdash;except the fashionable families of Newport!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This again brought us from the clouds of speculation down to Worship
      Street, where we were walking toward South Place. It also unexpectedly
      furnished me with the means to lead back our talk so gently, without a
      jolt or a jerk, to my moral and the delicate topic of matrimony from which
      he had dodged away, that he never awoke to what was coming until it had
      come. He began pointing out, as we passed them, certain houses which were
      now, or had at some period been, the dwellings of his many relatives: &ldquo;My
      cousin Julia So-and-so lives there,&rdquo; he would say; or, &ldquo;My great-uncle,
      known as Regent Tom, owned that before the War&rdquo;; and once, &ldquo;The Rev.
      Joseph Priedieu, my great-grandfather, built that house to marry his fifth
      wife in, but the grave claimed him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I asked him a riddle. &ldquo;What is the difference between Kings Port and
      Newport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he, of course, gave up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are all connected by marriage, and there they are all connected
      by divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very true. I met the most embarrassingly
      cater-cornered families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they weren&rsquo;t embarrassed!&rdquo; I interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I was,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told me you weren&rsquo;t innocent!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;They are going to
      institute a divorce march,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lohengrin&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; played backward. They have not settled which it
      is to be taught in the nursery with the other kindergarten melodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still unsuspectingly diverted; and we walked along until we turned
      in the direction of my boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever notice,&rdquo; I now said, &ldquo;what a perpetual allegory
      &lsquo;Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; contains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was just a fairy sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but when a great poet sets his hand to a fairy sort of thing, you
      get&mdash;well, you get poor Titania.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She fell in love with a jackass,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Puck bewitched her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. A lovely woman with her arms around a jackass. Does that never
      happen in Kings Port?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began smiling to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Puck isn&rsquo;t all dead yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was now in a position to begin dropping my bitters. &ldquo;Shakespeare was
      probably too gallant to put it the other way, and make Oberon fall in love
      with a female jackass. But what an allegory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed with another drop. &ldquo;Titania got out of it. It is not always
      solved so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; It was quite evident that the flavor of my
      bitters reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was walking slowly, with his head down, and frowning hard. We had now
      come to the steps of my boarding-house, and I dropped my last drop. &ldquo;But a
      disenchanted woman has the best of it&mdash;before marriage, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up quickly. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I evinced surprise. &ldquo;Why, she can always break off honorably, and we never
      can, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the third time this day he made me an astonishing rejoinder: &ldquo;Would
      you like to take orders from a negro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It reduced me to stammering. &ldquo;I have never&mdash;such a juncture has never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t. Even a Northerner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face, as he said this, was a single glittering piece of fierceness. I
      was still so much taken aback that I said rather flatly: &ldquo;But who has to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to.&rdquo; With this he abruptly turned on his heel and left me standing
      on the steps. For a moment I stared after him; and then, as I rang the
      bell, he was back again; and with that formality which at times overtook
      him he began: &ldquo;I will ask you to excuse my hasty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, John Mayrant! What a notion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was by no means to be put off, and he proceeded with stiffer
      formality: &ldquo;I feel that I have not acted politely just now, and I beg to
      assure you that I intended no slight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse was to lay a hand upon his shoulder and say to him: &ldquo;My
      dear fellow, stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; Thus I should have treated any Northern
      friend; but here was no Northerner. I am glad that I had the sense to feel
      that any careless, good-natured putting away of his deliberate and
      definitely tendered apology would seem to him a &ldquo;slight&rdquo; on my part. His
      punctilious value for certain observances between man and man reached me
      suddenly and deeply, and took me far from the familiarity which breeds
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, John Mayrant,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you could never offend me unless I thought
      that you wished to, and how should I possibly think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he replied very simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rang the bell a second time. &ldquo;If we can get into the house,&rdquo; I
      suggested, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you stop and dine with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going to accept. &ldquo;I shall be&mdash;&rdquo; he had begun, in tones of
      gratification, when in one instant his face was stricken with complete
      dismay. &ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo; he said; and this time he was gone indeed, and
      in a hurry most apparent. It resembled a flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the matter now? You will naturally think that it was an
      appointment with his ladylove which he had forgotten; this was certainly
      my supposition as I turned again to the front door. There stood one of the
      waitresses, glaring with her white eyes half out of her black face at the
      already distant back of John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I thought; but, before I could think any more, the tall, dreadful
      boarder&mdash;the lady whom I secretly called Juno&mdash;swept up the
      steps, and by me into the house, with a dignity that one might term
      deafening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waitress now muttered, or rather sang, a series of pious apostrophes.
      &ldquo;Oh, Lawd, de rampages and de ructions! Oh, Lawd, sinner is in my way,
      Daniel!&rdquo; She was strongly, but I think pleasurably, excited; and she next
      turned to me with a most natural grin, and saying, &ldquo;Chick&rsquo;n&rsquo;s mos&rsquo; gone,
      sah,&rdquo; she went back to the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This admonition sent me upstairs to make as hasty a toilet as I could.

    <h2>
      IX: Juno
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each recent remarkable occurrence had obliterated its predecessor, and it
      was with difficulty that I made a straight parting in my hair. Had it been
      Miss Rieppe that John so suddenly ran away to? It seemed now more as if
      the boy had been running away from somebody. The waitress had stared at
      him with extraordinary interest; she had seen his bruise; perhaps she knew
      how he had got it. Her excitement&mdash;had he smashed up his official
      superior at the custom house? That would be an impossible thing, I told
      myself instantly; as well might a nobleman cross swords with a peasant.
      Perhaps the stare of the waitress had reminded him of his bruise, and he
      might have felt disinclined to show himself with it in a company of
      gossiping strangers. Still, that would scarcely account for it&mdash;the
      dismay with which he had so suddenly left me. Was Juno the cause&mdash;she
      had come up behind me; he must have seen her and her portentous manner
      approaching&mdash;had the boy fled from her?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, his fierce outbreak about taking orders from a negro when I was
      moralizing over the misfortune of marrying a jackass! I got a sort of
      parting in my hair, and went down to the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno was there before me, with her bonnet, or rather her headdress, still
      on, and I heard her making apologies to Mrs. Trevise for being so late.
      Mrs. Trevise, of course, sat at the head of her table, and Juno sat at her
      right hand. I was very glad not to have a seat near Juno, because this
      lady was, as I have already hinted, an intolerable person to me. Either
      her Southern social position or her rent (she took the whole second floor,
      except Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s own rooms) was of importance to Mrs. Trevise; but I
      assure you that her ways kept our landlady&rsquo;s cold, impervious tact
      watchful from the beginning to the end of almost every meal. Juno was one
      of those persons who possess so many and such strong feelings themselves
      that they think they have all the feelings there are; at least, they
      certainly consider no one&rsquo;s feelings but their own. She possessed an
      inexhaustible store of anecdote, but it was exclusively about our Civil
      War; you would have supposed that nothing else had ever happened in the
      world. When conversation among the rest of us became general, she
      preserved a cold and acrid inattention; when the fancy took her to open
      her own mouth, it was always to begin some reminiscence, and the
      reminiscence always began: &ldquo;In September, 1862, when the Northern
      vandals,&rdquo; etc., etc., or &ldquo;When the Northern vandals were repulsed by my
      husband&rsquo;s cousin, General Braxton Bragg,&rdquo; etc., etc. Now it was not that I
      was personally wounded by the term, because at the time of the vandals I
      was not even born, and also because I know that vandals cannot be kept out
      of any army. Deeply as I believed the March to the Sea to have been
      imperative, of &ldquo;Sherman&rsquo;s bummers&rdquo; and their excesses I had a fair
      historic knowledge and a very poor opinion; and this I should have been
      glad to tell Juno, had she ever given me the chance; but her immodest
      sympathy for herself froze all sympathy for her. Why could she not
      preserve a well-bred silence upon her sufferings, as did the other old
      ladies I had met in Kings Port? Why did she drag them in, thrust them,
      poke them, shove them at you? Thus it was that for her insulting disregard
      of those whom her words might wound I detested Juno; and as she was a
      woman, and nearly old enough to be my grandmother, it was, of course, out
      of the question that I should retaliate. When she got very bad indeed, it
      was calm Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s last, but effective, resort to tinkle a little
      handbell and scold one of the waitresses whom its sound would then summon
      from the kitchen. This bell was tinkled not always by any means for my
      sake; other travellers from the North there were who came and went,
      pausing at Kings Port between Florida and their habitual abodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present our company consisted of Juno; a middle-class Englishman
      employed in some business capacity in town; a pair of very young
      honeymooners from the &ldquo;up-country&rdquo;; a Louisiana poetess, who wore the
      long, cylindrical ringlets of 1830, and who was attending a convention the
      Daughters of Dixie; two or three males and females, best described as et
      ceteras; and myself. &ldquo;I shall only take a mouthful for the sake of
      nourishment,&rdquo; Juno was announcing, &ldquo;and then I shall return to his
      bedside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he very suffering?&rdquo; inquired the poetess, in melodious accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an infamous onslaught,&rdquo; Juno replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetess threw up her eyes and crooned, &ldquo;Noble, doughty champion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say so indeed, madam,&rdquo; said Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raw beefsteak&rsquo;s jolly good for your eye,&rdquo; observed the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion did not appear to be heard by Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a row with a chap,&rdquo; the Briton continued. He&rsquo;s my best friend now.
      He made me put raw beefsteak&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; interrupted Juno. &ldquo;He requires no beefsteak, raw or
      cooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the Briton reddened. &ldquo;Too groggy to eat, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trevise tinkled her bell. &ldquo;Daphne! I have said to you twice to hand
      those yams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I done handed &lsquo;em twice, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand them right away, Daphne, and don&rsquo;t be so forgetful.&rdquo; It was not easy
      to disturb the composure of Mrs. Trevise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetess now took up the broken thread. &ldquo;Had I a son,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I
      would sooner witness him starve than hear him take orders from a menial
      race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mightn&rsquo;t starving be harder for him to experience than for you to
      witness, y&rsquo; know?&rdquo; asked the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this one of the et ceteras made a sort of snuffing noise, and ate his
      dinner hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the male honeymooner who next spoke. &ldquo;Must have been quite a
      tussle, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an infamous onslaught!&rdquo; repeated Juno. &ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d seen it!&rdquo; sighed
      the honeymooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bride smiled at him beamingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have felt right lonesome to be
      out of it, David.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No apology has yet been offered,&rdquo; continued Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But must your nephew apologize besides taking a licking?&rdquo; inquired the
      Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno turned an awful face upon hint. &ldquo;It is from his brutal assailant that
      apologies are due. Mr. Mayrant&rsquo;s family&rdquo; (she paused here for blighting
      emphasis) &ldquo;are well-bred people, and he will be coerced into behaving like
      a gentleman for once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I checked an impulse here to speak out and express my doubts as to the
      family coercion being founded upon any dissatisfaction with John&rsquo;s
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if reading or recitation might not soothe your nephew?&rdquo; said the
      poetess, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should doubt it,&rdquo; answered Juno. &ldquo;I have just come from his bedside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should so like to soothe him, if I could,&rdquo; the poetess murmured. &ldquo;If he
      were well enough to hear my convention ode&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not nearly well enough,&rdquo; said Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      The et cetera here coughed and blew his nose so remarkably that we all
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short silence followed, which Juno relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give the young ruffian&rsquo;s family the credit they deserve,&rdquo; she
      stated. &ldquo;The whole connection despises his keeping the position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another et cetera now came into it. &ldquo;Is it known what exactly precipitated
      the occurrence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juno turned to him. &ldquo;My nephew is a gentleman from whose lips no unworthy
      word could ever fall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the et cetera, mildly. &ldquo;He said something, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He conveyed a well-merited rebuke in fitting terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were the terms?&rdquo; inquired the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno again did not hear him. &ldquo;It was after a friendly game of cards. My
      nephew protested against any gentleman remaining at the custom house since
      the recent insulting appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was now almost the only member of the party who had preserved strict
      silence throughout this very interesting conversation, because, having no
      wish to converse with Juno at any time, I especially did not desire it
      now, just after her seeing me (I thought she must have seen me) in
      amicable conference with the object of her formidable displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every Mayrant is ferocious that I ever heard of,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You
      cannot trust that seemingly delicate and human exterior. His father had
      it, too&mdash;deceiving exterior and raging interior, though I will say
      for that one that he would never have stooped to humiliate the family name
      as his son is doing. His regiment was near by when the Northern vandals
      burned our courthouse, and he made them run, I can tell you! It&rsquo;s a mercy
      for that poor girl that the scales have dropped from her eyes and she has
      broken her engagement with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the father?&rdquo; asked a third et cetera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno stared at the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trevise drawled a calm contribution. &ldquo;The father died before this boy
      was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; murmured the et cetera, gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno proceeded. &ldquo;No woman&rsquo;s life would be safe with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mightn&rsquo;t he be safer for a person&rsquo;s niece than for their nephew?&rdquo;
       said the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s hand moved toward the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Juno answered the question mournfully: &ldquo;With such hereditary
      bloodthirstiness, who can tell?&rdquo; And so Mrs. Trevise moved her hand away
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but do you know if the other gentleman is laid up, too?&rdquo;
       inquired the male honeymooner, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy to understand that he is,&rdquo; replied Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sheer amazement I burst out, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and abruptly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late. I had instantly become the centre of interest. The et
      ceteras and honeymooners craned their necks; the Briton leaned toward me
      from opposite; the poetess, who had worn an absent expression since being
      told that the injured champion was not nearly well enough to listen to her
      ode, now put on her glasses and gazed at me kindly; while Juno reared her
      headdress and spoke, not to me, but to the air in my general neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one later intelligence than what I bring from my nephew&rsquo;s
      bedside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she hadn&rsquo;t perceived who my companion at the step had been! Well, she
      should be enlightened, they all should be enlightened, and vengeance was
      mine. I spoke with gentleness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nephew&rsquo;s impressions, I fear, are still confused by his deplorable
      misadventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what you know about his impressions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of the corner of my eye I saw the hand of Mrs. Trevise move toward her
      bell; but she wished to hear all about it more than she wished concord at
      her harmonious table; and the hand stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno spoke again. &ldquo;Who, pray, has later news than what I bring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My enemy was in my hand; and an enemy in the hand is worth I don&rsquo;t know
      how many in the bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered most gently: &ldquo;I do not come from Mr. Mayrant&rsquo;s bedside, because
      I have just left him at the front door in sound health&mdash;saving a
      bruise over his left eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During a second we all sat in a high-strung silence, and then Juno became
      truly superb. &ldquo;Who sees the scars he brazenly conceals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took away my breath; my battle would have been lost, when the Briton
      suggested: &ldquo;But mayn&rsquo;t he have shown those to his Aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat in no silence now; the first et cetera made extraordinary sounds on
      his plate, Mrs. Trevise tinkled her handbell with more unction than I had
      ever yet seen in her; and while she and Daphne interchanged streams of
      severe words which I was too disconcerted to follow, the other et ceteras
      and the honeymooners hectically effervesced into small talk. I presently
      found myself eating our last course amid a reestablished calm, when, with
      a rustle, Juno swept out from among us, to return (I suppose) to the
      bedside. As she passed behind the Briton&rsquo;s chair, that invaluable person
      kicked me under the table, and on my raising my eyes to him he gave me a
      large, robust wink.

    <h2>
      X: High Walk and the Ladies
    </h2>
    <p>
      I now burned to put many questions to the rest of the company. If, through
      my foolish and outreaching slyness with the girl behind the counter, the
      door of my comprehension had been shut, Juno had now opened it
      sufficiently wide for a number of facts to come crowding in, so to speak,
      abreast. Indeed, their simultaneous arrival was not a little confusing, as
      if several visitors had burst in upon me and at once begun speaking
      loudly, each shouting a separate and important matter which demanded my
      intelligent consideration. John Mayrant worked in the custom house, and
      Kings Port frowned upon this; not merely Kings Port in general&mdash;which
      counted little with the boy, if indeed he noticed general opinion at all&mdash;but
      the boy&rsquo;s particular Kings Port, his severe old aunts, and his cousins,
      and the pretty girl at the Exchange, and the men he played cards with, all
      these frowned upon it, too; yet even this condemnation one could disregard
      if some lofty personal principle, some pledge to one&rsquo;s own sacred honor,
      were at stake&mdash;but here was no such thing: John Mayrant hated the
      position himself. The salary? No, the salary would count for nothing in
      the face of such a prejudice as I had seen glitter from his eye! A strong,
      clever youth of twenty-three, with the world before him, and no one to
      support&mdash;stop! Hortense Rieppe! There was the lofty personal
      principle, the sacred pledge to honor; he was engaged presently to endow
      her with all his worldly goods; and to perform this faithfully a
      bridegroom must not, no matter how little he liked &ldquo;taking orders from a
      negro,&rdquo; fling away his worldly goods some few days before he was to
      pronounce his bridegroom&rsquo;s vow. So here, at Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s dinner-table, I
      caught for one moment, to the full, a vision of the unhappy boy&rsquo;s plight;
      he was sticking to a task which he loathed that he might support a wife
      whom he no longer desired. Such, as he saw it, was his duty; and nobody,
      not even a soul of his kin or his kind, gave him a word or a thought of
      understanding, gave him anything except the cold shoulder. Yes; from one
      soul he had got a sign&mdash;from aged Daddy Ben, at the churchyard gate;
      and amid my jostling surmises and conclusions, that quaint speech of the
      old negro, that little act of fidelity and affection from the heart of a
      black man, took on a strange pathos in its isolation amid the general
      harshness of his white superiors. Over this it was that I was pausing
      when, all in a second, perplexity again ruled my meditations. Juno had
      said that the engagement was broken. Well, if that were the case&mdash;But
      was it likely to be the case? Juno&rsquo;s agreeable habit, a habit grown
      familiar to all of us in the house, was to sprinkle about, along with her
      vitriol, liberal quantities of the by-product of inaccuracy. Mingled with
      her latest illustrations, she had poured out for us one good dose of
      falsehood, the antidote for which it had been my happy office to
      administer on the spot. If John Mayrant wasn&rsquo;t in bed from the wounds of
      combat, as she had given us to suppose, perhaps Hortense Rieppe hadn&rsquo;t
      released him from his plighted troth, as Juno had also announced; and
      distinct relief filled me when I reasoned this out. I leave others to
      reason out why it was relief, and why a dull disappointment had come over
      me at the news that the match was off. This, for me, should have been good
      news, when you consider that I had been so lately telling myself such a
      marriage must not be, that I must myself, somehow (since no one else
      would), step in and arrest the calamity; and it seems odd that I should
      have felt this blankness and regret upon learning that the parties had
      happily settled it for themselves, and hence my difficult and delicate
      assistance was never to be needed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did any one else now sitting at our table know of Miss Rieppe&rsquo;s reported
      act? What particulars concerning John&rsquo;s fight had been given by Juno
      before my entrance? It didn&rsquo;t surprise me that her nephew was in bed from
      Master Mayrant&rsquo;s lusty blows. One could readily guess the manner in which
      young John, with his pent-up fury over the custom house, would &ldquo;land&rdquo; his
      chastisement all over the person of any rash critic! And what a talking
      about it must be going on everywhere to-day! If Kings Port tongues had
      been set in motion over me and my small notebook in a library, the whole
      town must be buzzing over every bruise given and taken in this evidently
      emphatic battle. I had hoped to glean some more precise information from
      my fellow-boarders after Juno had disembarrassed us of her sonorous
      presence; but even if they were possessed of all the facts which I lacked,
      Mrs. Trevise in some masterly fashion of her own banished the subject from
      further discussion. She held us off from it chiefly, I think, by adopting
      a certain upright posture in her chair, and a certain tone when she
      inquired if we wished a second help of the pudding. After thirty-five
      years of boarders and butchers, life held no secrets or surprises for her;
      she was a mature, lone, disenchanted, able lady, and even her silence was
      like an arm of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      An all too brief conversation, nipped by Mrs. Trevise at a stage even
      earlier than the bud, revealed to me that perhaps my fellow-boarders would
      have been glad to ask me questions, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the male honeymooner who addressed me. &ldquo;Did I understand you to
      say, sir, that Mr. Mayrant had received a bruise over his left eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daphne!&rdquo; called out Mrs. Trevise, &ldquo;Mr. Henderson will take an orange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so we finished our meal without further reference to eyes, or noses,
      or anything of the sort. It was just as well, I reflected, when I reached
      my room, that I on my side had been asked no questions, since I most
      likely knew less than the others who had heard all that Juno had to say;
      and it would have been humiliating, after my superb appearance of knowing
      more, to explain that John Mayrant had walked with me all the way from the
      Library, and never told me a word about the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection increased my esteem for the boy&rsquo;s admirable reticence.
      What private matter of his own had I ever learned from him? It was other
      people, invariably, who told me of his troubles. There had been that
      single, quickly controlled outbreak about his position in the Custom
      House, and also he had let fall that touching word concerning his faith
      and his liking to say his prayers in the place where his mother had said
      them; beyond this, there had never yet been anything of all that must at
      the present moment be intimately stirring in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should I &ldquo;like to take orders from a negro?&rdquo; Put personally, it came to me
      now as a new idea came as something which had never entered my mind
      before, not even as an abstract hypothesis I didn&rsquo;t have to think before
      reaching the answer though; something within me, which you ma call what
      you please&mdash;convention, prejudice, instinct&mdash;something answered
      most prompt and emphatically in the negative. I revolved in my mind as I
      tried to pack into a box a number of objects that I had bought in one or
      to &ldquo;antique&rdquo; shops. They wouldn&rsquo;t go in, the objects; they were of
      defeating and recalcitrant shapes, and of hostile materials&mdash;glass
      and brass&mdash;and I must have a larger box made, and in that case I
      would buy this afternoon the other kettle-supporter (I forget its right
      name) and have the whole lot decently packed. Take orders from a colored
      man? Have him give you directions, dictate you letters, discipline you if
      you were unpunctual? No, indeed! And if such were my feeling, how must
      this young Southerner feel? With this in my mind, I made sure that the
      part in my back hair was right, and after that precaution soon found
      myself on my way, in a way somewhat roundabout, to the kettle-supporter
      sauntering northward along High Walk, and stopping often; the town, and
      the water, and the distant shores all were so lovely, so belonged to one
      another, so melted into one gentle impression of wistfulness and
      tenderness! I leaned upon the stone parapet and enjoyed the quiet which
      every surrounding detail brought to my senses. How could John Mayrant
      endure such a situation? I continued to wonder; and I also continued to
      assure myself it was absurd to suppose that the engagement was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shutting of a front door across the street almost directly behind me
      attracted my attention because of its being the first sound that had
      happened in noiseless, empty High Walk since I had been strolling there;
      and I turned from the parapet to see that I was no longer the solitary
      person in the street. Two ladies, one tall and one diminutive, both in
      black and with long black veils which they had put back from their faces,
      were evidently coming from a visit. As the tall one bowed to me I
      recognized Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, and took off my hat. It was not until
      they had crossed the street and come up the stone steps near where I stood
      on High Walk that the little lady also bowed to me; she was Mrs. Weguelin
      St. Michael, and from something in her prim yet charming manner I gathered
      that she held it to be not perfectly well-bred in a lady to greet a
      gentleman across the width of a public highway, and that she could have
      wished that her tall companion had not thus greeted me, a stranger likely
      to comment upon Kings Port manners. In her eyes, such free deportment
      evidently went with her tall companion&rsquo;s method of speech: hadn&rsquo;t the
      little lady informed me during our first brief meeting that Kings Port at
      times thought Mrs. Gregory St. Michael&rsquo;s tongue &ldquo;too downright&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies having graciously granted me permission to join them while
      they took the air, Mrs. Gregory must surely have shocked Mrs. Weguelin by
      saying to me, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a penny for your thoughts, but I&rsquo;ll exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you thus bargain in the dark, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll risk that; and, to say truth, even your back, as we came out of
      that house, was a back of thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I confess to some thinking. Shall I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Weguelin who quickly replied, smiling: &ldquo;Ladies first, you
      know. At least we still keep it so in Kings Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would we did everywhere!&rdquo; I exclaimed devoutly; and I was quite aware
      that beneath the little lady&rsquo;s gentle smile a setting down had lurked, a
      setting down of the most delicate nature, administered to me not in the
      least because I had deserved one, but because she did not like Mrs.
      Gregory&rsquo;s &ldquo;downright&rdquo; tongue, and could not stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory now took the prerogative of ladies, and began. &ldquo;I was
      thinking of what we had all just been saying during our visit across the
      way&mdash;and with which you are not going to agree&mdash;that our young
      people would do much better to let us old people arrange their marriages
      for them, as it Is done in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that you would not agree; but that is because you are so young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that twenty-eight is so young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know it when you are seventy-three.&rdquo; This observation again came
      from Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael, and again with a gentle and attractive
      smile. It was only the second time that she had spoken; and throughout the
      talk into which we now fell as we slowly walked up and down High Walk, she
      never took the lead; she left that to the &ldquo;downright&rdquo; tongue&mdash;but I
      noticed, however, that she chose her moments to follow the lead very
      aptly. I also perceived plainly that what we were really going to discuss
      was not at all the European principle of marriage-making, but just simply
      young John and his Hortense; they were the true kernel of the nut with
      whose concealing shell Mrs. Gregory was presenting me, and in proposing an
      exchange of thoughts she would get back only more thoughts upon the same
      subject. It was pretty evident how much Kings Port was buzzing over all
      this! They fondly believed they did not like it; but what would they have
      done without it? What, indeed, were they going to do when it was all over
      and done with, one way or another? As a matter of fact, they ought to be
      grateful to Hortense for contributing illustriously to the excitement of
      their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I am well aware,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory pursued, &ldquo;that the young people
      of to-day believe they can all &lsquo;teach their grandmothers to suck eggs,&rsquo; as
      we say in Kings Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We say it elsewhere, too,&rdquo; I mildly put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? I didn&rsquo;t know that the North, with its pest of Hebrew and other
      low immigrants, had retained any of the good old homely saws which we
      brought from England. But do you imagine that if the control of marriage
      rested in the hands of parents and grandparents (where it properly
      belongs), you would be witnessing in the North this disgusting spectacle
      of divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mrs. St. Michael&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t invite you to argue when we invited you to walk!&rdquo; cried the
      lady, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should like you to answer the question,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weguelin St.
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell us,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory continued, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s your opinion that a boy
      who has never been married is a better judge of matrimony&rsquo;s pitfalls than
      his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or than any older person who has bravely and worthily gone through with
      the experience,&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies, I&rsquo;ve no mind to argue. But we&rsquo;re ahead of Europe; we don&rsquo;t need
      their clumsy old plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory gave a gallant, incredulous snort. &ldquo;I shall be interested to
      learn of anything that is done better here than in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, many things, surely! But especially the mating of the fashionable
      young. They don&rsquo;t need any parents to arrange for them; it&rsquo;s much better
      managed through precocity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through precocity? I scarcely follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Weguelin softly added, &ldquo;You must excuse us if we do not follow
      you.&rdquo; But her softness nevertheless indicated that if there were any one
      present needing leniency, it was myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; I told them, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s through precocity. The new-rich American no
      longer commits the blunder of keeping his children innocent. You&rsquo;ll see it
      beginning in the dancing-class, where I heard an exquisite little girl of
      six say to a little boy, &lsquo;Go away; I can&rsquo;t dance with you, because my
      mamma says your mamma only keeps a maid to answer the doorbell.&rsquo; When they
      get home from the dancing-class, tutors in poker and bridge are waiting to
      teach them how to gamble for each other&rsquo;s little dimes. I saw a little boy
      in knickerbockers and a wide collar throw down the evening paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that age? They read the papers?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They read nothing else at any age. He threw it down and said, &lsquo;Well, I
      guess there&rsquo;s not much behind this raid on Steel Preferred.&rsquo; What need has
      such a boy for parents or grandparents? Presently he is travelling to a
      fashionable boarding-school in his father&rsquo;s private car. At college all
      his adolescent curiosities are lavishly gratified. His sister at home
      reads the French romances, and by eighteen she, too, knows (in her head at
      least) the whole of life, so that she can be perfectly trusted; she would
      no more marry a mere half-millionaire just because she loved him than she
      would appear twice in the same ball-dress. She and her ball-dresses are
      described in the papers precisely as if she were an animal at a show&mdash;which
      indeed is what she has become; and she&rsquo;s eager to be thus described,
      because she and her mother&mdash;even if her mother was once a lady and
      knew better&mdash;are haunted by one perpetual, sickening fear, the fear
      of being left out. And if you desire to pay correct ballroom compliments,
      you no longer go to her mother and tell her she&rsquo;s looking every bit as
      young as her daughter; you go to the daughter and tell her she&rsquo;s looking
      every bit as old as her mother, for that&rsquo;s what she wishes to do, that&rsquo;s
      what she tries for, what she talks, dresses, eats, drinks, goes to
      indecent plays and laughs for. Yes, we manage it through precocity, and
      the new-rich American parent has achieved at least one new thing under the
      sun, namely, the corruption of the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My ladies silently consulted each other&rsquo;s expressions, after which, in
      equal silence, their gaze returned to me; but their equally intent
      scrutiny was expressive of quite different things. It was with expectancy
      that Mrs. Gregory looked at me&mdash;she wanted more. Not so Mrs.
      Weguelin; she gave me disapproval; it was shadowed in her beautiful,
      lustrous eyes that burned dark in her white face with as much fire as that
      of youth, yet it was not of youth, being deeply charged with
      retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what, then, had I sinned? For the little lady&rsquo;s next words, coldly
      murmured, increased in me an uneasiness, as of sin:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told us much that we are not accustomed to hear in Kings Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t begun to tell you!&rdquo; I exclaimed cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly have not told us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;how your &lsquo;precocity&rsquo; 
      escapes this divorce degradation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escape it? Those people think it is&mdash;well, provincial&mdash;not to
      have been divorced at least once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory opened her eyes, but Mrs. Weguelin shut her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued: &ldquo;Even the children, for their own little reasons, like it.
      Only last summer, in Newport, a young boy was asked how he enjoyed having
      a father and an ex-father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ex-father!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory. &ldquo;Vice-father is what I should call him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Weguelin, &ldquo;how can you jest upon such topics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from jesting, Julia. Well, young gentleman, and what answer did
      this precious Newport child make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said (if you will pardon my giving you his little sentiment in his own
      quite expressive idiom), &lsquo;Me for two fathers! Double money birthdays and
      Christmases. See?&rsquo; That was how he saw divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again my ladies consulted each other&rsquo;s expressions; we moved along
      High Walk in such silence that I heard the stiff little rustle which the
      palmettos were making across the street; even these trees, you might have
      supposed, were whispering together over the horrors that I had recited in
      their decorous presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Gregory who next spoke. &ldquo;I can translate that last boy&rsquo;s
      language, but what did the other boy mean about a &lsquo;raid on Steel
      Preferred&rsquo;&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve got the jargon right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I translated this for her, I felt again the disapproval in Mrs.
      Weguelin&rsquo;s dark eyes; and my sins&mdash;for they were twofold&mdash;were
      presently made clear to me by this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are such subjects as&mdash;as stocks&rdquo; (she softly cloaked this word in
      scorn immeasurable)&mdash;&ldquo;are such subjects mentioned in your good
      society at the North?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed heartily. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s mentioned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady paused over my reply. &ldquo;I am afraid you must feel us to be very
      old-fashioned in, Kings Port,&rdquo; she then said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I rejoice in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ignored my not wholly dexterous compliment. &ldquo;And some subjects,&rdquo; she
      pursued, &ldquo;seem to us so grave that if we permit ourselves to speak of them
      at all we cannot speak of them lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, they couldn&rsquo;t speak of them lightly! Here, then, stood my two sins
      revealed; everything I had imparted, and also my tone of imparting it, had
      displeased Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael, not with the thing, but with me. I
      had transgressed her sound old American code of good manners, a code
      slightly pompous no doubt, but one in which no familiarity was allowed to
      breed contempt. To her good taste, there were things in the world which
      had, apparently, to exist, but which one banished from drawing-room
      discussion as one conceals from sight the kitchen and outhouses; one dealt
      with them only when necessity compelled, and never in small-talk; and here
      had I been, so to speak, small-talking them in that glib, modern,
      irresponsible cadence with which our brazen age rings and clatters like
      the beating of triangles and gongs. Not triangles and gongs, but rather
      strings and flutes, had been the music to which Kings Port society had
      attuned its measured voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw it all, and even saw that my own dramatic sense of Mrs. Weguelin&rsquo;s
      dignity had perversely moved me to be more flippant than I actually felt;
      and I promised myself that a more chastened tone should forthwith redeem
      me from the false position I had got into.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory to Mrs. Weguelin, &ldquo;we must ask him to excuse
      our provincialism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time I was not wholly dexterous. &ldquo;But I like it so much!&rdquo; I
      exclaimed; and both ladies laughed frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory brought in a fable. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find us all &lsquo;country mice&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time I was happy. &ldquo;At least, then, there&rsquo;ll be no cat!&rdquo; And this
      caused us all to make little bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the word &ldquo;cat&rdquo; fell into our talk as does a drop of some acid into a
      chemical solution, instantly changing the whole to an unexpected new
      color. The unexpected new color was, in this instance, merely what had
      been latently lurking in the fluid of our consciousness all through and
      now it suddenly came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory stared over the parapet at the harbor. &ldquo;I wonder if anybody
      has visited that steam yacht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hermana?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s waiting, I believe, for her owner, who is
      enjoying himself very much on land.&rdquo; It was a strong temptation to add,
      &ldquo;enjoying himself with the cat,&rdquo; but I resisted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory. &ldquo;Possibly a friend of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even his name is unknown to me. But I gather that he may be coming to
      Kings Port&mdash;to attend Mr. John Mayrant&rsquo;s wedding next Wednesday
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hadn&rsquo;t gathered this; but one is at times driven to improvising. I
      wished so much to know if Juno was right about the engagement being
      broken, and I looked hard at the ladies as my words fairly grazed the
      &ldquo;cat.&rdquo; This time I expected them to consult each other&rsquo;s expressions, and
      such, indeed, was their immediate proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wednesday following, you mean,&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postponed again? Dear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory spoke this time. &ldquo;General Rieppe. Less well again, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be like Juno to magnify a delay into a rupture. Then I had a
      hilarious thought, which I instantly put to the ladies. &ldquo;If the poor
      General were to die completely, would the wedding be postponed
      completely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would not be the slightest chance of that,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory declared.
      And then she pronounced a sentence that was truly oracular: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming
      at once to see for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which Mrs. Weguelin added with deeper condemnation than she had so far
      employed at all: &ldquo;There is a rumor that she is actually coming in an
      automobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My silence upon these two remarks was the silence of great and sudden
      interest; but it led Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael to do my perceptions a
      slight injustice, and she had no intention that I should miss the quality
      of her opinion regarding the vehicle in which Hortense was reported to be
      travelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rieppe has the extraordinary taste to come here in an automobile,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael, with deepened severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I understood quite well, without this emphasizing, that the little
      lady would, with her unbending traditions, probably think it more
      respectable to approach Kings Port in a wheelbarrow, I was absorbed by the
      vague but copious import of Mrs. Gregory&rsquo;s announcement. The oracles,
      moreover, continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is undoubtedly very clever to come and see for herself,&rdquo; was Mrs.
      Weguelin&rsquo;s next comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory&rsquo;s face, as she replied to her companion, took on a censorious
      and superior expression. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember, Julia, that I told Josephine
      St. Michael it was what they had to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not Josephine, my dear, who at any time approved of taking
      such a course. It was Eliza&rsquo;s whole doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was fairly raining oracles round me, and they quite resembled, for all
      the help and light they contained, their Delphic predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet Eliza,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;in the face of it, this very morning,
      repeated her eternal assertion that we shall all see the marriage will not
      take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Weguelin, &ldquo;rates few things more highly than her
      own judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory mused. &ldquo;Yet she is often right when she has no right to be
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not bear it any longer, and I said, &ldquo;I heard to-day that Miss
      Rieppe had broken her engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did you hear that nonsense?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart leaped, and I told her where.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well! you will hear anything in a boarding-house. Indeed, that would
      be a great deal too good to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask where Miss Rieppe is all this while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last news was from Palm Beach, where the air was said to be necessary
      for the General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin repeated, &ldquo;we have every reason to believe that she
      is coming here in an automobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to call, of course,&rdquo; added Mrs. Gregory to her, not to me;
      they were leaving me out of it. Yes, these ladies were forgetting about me
      in their using preoccupation over whatever crisis it was that now hung
      over John Mayrant&rsquo;s love affairs&mdash;a preoccupation which was evidently
      part of Kings Port&rsquo;s universal buzz to-day, and which my joining them in
      the street had merely mitigated for a moment. I did not wish to be left
      out of it; I cannot tell you why&mdash;perhaps it was contagious in the
      local air&mdash;but a veritable madness of craving to know about it seized
      upon me. Of course, I saw that Miss Rieppe was, almost too grossly and
      obviously, &ldquo;playing for time&rdquo;; the health of people&rsquo;s fathers did not
      cause weekly extensions of this sort. But what was it that the young lady
      expected time to effect for her? Her release, formally, by her young man,
      on the ground of his worldly ill fortune? Or was it for an offer from the
      owner of the Hermana that she was waiting, before she should take the step
      of formally releasing John Mayrant? No, neither of these conjectures
      seemed to furnish a key to the tactics of Miss Rieppe and the theory that
      each of these affianced parties was strategizing to cause the other to
      assume the odium of breaking their engagement, with no result save that of
      repeatedly countermanding a wedding-cake, struck me as belonging admirably
      to a stage-comedy in three acts, but scarcely to life as we find it.
      Besides, poor John Mayrant was, all too plainly, not strategizing; he was
      playing as straight a game as the honest heart of a gentleman could
      inspire. And so, baffled at all points, I said (for I simply had to try
      something which might lead to my sharing in Kings Port&rsquo;s vibrating
      secret):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out whether she wants to marry him or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory answered. &ldquo;That is just what she is coming to see for
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since her love was for his phosphates only&mdash;!&rdquo; was my natural
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It caused (and this time I did not expect it) my inveterate ladies to
      consult each other&rsquo;s expressions. They prolonged their silence so much
      that I spoke again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And backing out of this sort of thing can be done, I should think, quite
      as cleverly, and much more simply, from a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Weguelin who answered now, or, rather, who headed me off.
      &ldquo;Have you been able to make out whether he wants to marry her or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he never comes near any of that with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. But we all understand that he has taken a fancy to you,
      and that you have talked much with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they all understood this, did they? This, too, had played its little
      special part in the buzz? Very well, then, nothing of my private
      impressions should drop from my lips here, to be quoted and misquoted and
      battledored and shuttlecocked, until it reached the boy himself (as it
      would inevitably) in fantastic disarrangement. I laughed. &ldquo;Oh, yes! I have
      talked much with him. Shakespeare, I think, was our latest subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weguelin was plainly watching for something to drop. &ldquo;Shakespeare!&rdquo;
       Her tone was of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then indulged myself in that most delightful sort of impertinence, which
      consists in the other person&rsquo;s not seeing it. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to
      have heard of that yet. It occurred only before dinner to-day. But we have
      also talked optimism, pessimism, sociology, evolution&mdash;Mr. Mayrant
      would soon become quite&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped myself on the edge of something
      very clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sharp Mrs. Gregory finished for me. &ldquo;Yes, you mean that if he didn&rsquo;t
      live in Kings Port (where we still have reverence, at any rate), he fit
      would imbibe all the shallow quackeries of the hour and resemble all the
      clever young donkeys of the minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin murmurously expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory immediately made me a handsome but equivocal apology. &ldquo;I
      wasn&rsquo;t thinking of you at all!&rdquo; she declared gayly; and it set me doubting
      if perhaps she hadn&rsquo;t, after all, comprehended my impertinence. &ldquo;And,
      thank Heaven!&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;John is one of us, in spite of his present
      stubborn course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Weguelin&rsquo;s beautiful eyes were resting upon me with that
      disapproval I had come to know. To her, sociology and evolution and all
      &ldquo;isms&rdquo; were new-fangled inventions and murky with offense; to touch them
      was defilement, and in disclosing them to John Mayrant I was a corrupter
      of youth. She gathered it all up into a word that was radiant with a kind
      of lovely maternal gentleness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should not wish John to become radical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her voice, the whole of old Kings Port was enshrined: hereditary faith
      and hereditary standards, mellow with the adherence of generations past,
      and solicitous for the boy of the young generation. I saw her eyes soften
      at the thought of him; and throughout the rest of our talk to its end her
      gaze would now and then return to me, shadowed with disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      I addressed Mrs. Gregory. &ldquo;By his &lsquo;present stubborn course&rsquo; I suppose you
      mean the Custom House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of us deplore his obstinacy. His Aunt Eliza has strongly but vainly
      expostulated with him. And after that, Miss Josephine felt obliged to tell
      him that he need not come to see her again until he resigned a position
      which reflects ignominy upon us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppressed a whistle. I thought (as I have said earlier) that I had
      caught a full vision of John Mayrant&rsquo;s present plight. But my imagination
      had not soared to the height of Miss Josephine St. Michael&rsquo;s act of
      discipline. This, it must have been, that the boy had checked himself from
      telling me in the churchyard. What a character of sterner times was Miss
      Josephine! I thought of Aunt Carola, but even she was not quite of this
      iron, and I said so to Mrs. Gregory. &ldquo;I doubt if there be any old lady
      left in the North,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;capable of such antique severity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Gregory opened my eyes still further. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d have them if you
      had the negro to deal with as we have him. Miss Josephine,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;has to-day removed her sentence of banishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt on the verge of new discoveries. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;and did she
      relent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New circumstances intervened,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory loftily explained. &ldquo;There was
      an occurrence&mdash;an encounter, in fact&mdash;in which John Mayrant
      fittingly punished one who had presumed. Upon hearing of it, this morning,
      Miss Josephine sent a message to John that he might resume visiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is perfectly grand!&rdquo; I cried in my delight over Miss Josephine
      as a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly natural,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Gregory, quietly. &ldquo;John has
      behaved with credit throughout. He was at length made to see that
      circumstances forbade any breach between his family and that of the other
      young man. John held back&mdash;who would not, after such an insult?&mdash;but
      Miss Josephine was firm, and he has promised to call and shake hands. My
      cousin, Doctor Beaugarcon, assures me that the young man&rsquo;s injuries are
      trifling&mdash;a week will see him restored and presentable again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week? A mere nothing!&rdquo; I answered &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I now suggested, &ldquo;that
      you have forgotten to ask me what I was thinking about when we met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, young gentleman! and was it so remarkable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, but it partly answers what Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael asked
      me. If a young man does not really wish to marry a young woman there are
      ways well known by which she can be brought to break the engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;of course; gayeties and irregularities&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, if he&rsquo;s not above them,&rdquo; I hastily subjoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, by any means,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory returned. &ldquo;Kings Port has been
      treated to some episodes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weguelin put in a word of defence. &ldquo;It is to be said, Maria, that
      John&rsquo;s irregularities have invariably been conducted with perfect
      propriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;no Mayrant was ever known to be gross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this particular young lady,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weguelin, &ldquo;would not be
      estranged by an masculine irregularities and gayeties. Not many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about infidelities?&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;If he should flagrantly lose his
      heart to another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weguelin replied quickly. &ldquo;That answers very well where hearts are in
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;since phosphates are no longer&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;It would be a new dilemma,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory then said
      slowly, &ldquo;if she turned out to care for him, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throughout all this I was getting more and more the sense of how a total
      circle of people, a well-filled, wide circle of interested people,
      surrounded and cherished John Mayrant, made itself the setting of which he
      was the jewel; I felt in it, even stronger than the manifestation of
      personal affection (which certainly was strong enough), a collective sense
      of possession in him, a clan value, a pride and a guardianship
      concentrated and jealous, as of an heir to some princely estate, who must
      be worthy for the sake of a community even before he was worthy for his
      own sake. Thus he might amuse himself&mdash;it was in the code that
      princely heirs so should pour se deniaiser, as they neatly put it in Paris&mdash;thus
      might he and must he fight when his dignity was assailed; but thus might
      he not marry outside certain lines prescribed, or depart from his circle&rsquo;s
      established creeds, divine and social, especially to hold any position
      which (to borrow Mrs. Gregory&rsquo;s phrase) &ldquo;reflected ignominy&rdquo; upon them
      all. When he transgressed, their very value for him turned them bitter
      against him. I know that all of us are more or less chained to our
      community, which is pleased to expect us to walk its way, and mightily
      displeased when we please ourselves instead by breaking the chain and
      walking our own way; and I know that we are forgiven very slowly; but I
      had not dreamed what a prisoner to communal criticism a young American
      could be until I beheld Kings Port over John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to what estate was this prince heir? Alas, his inheritance was all of
      it the Past and none of it the Future; was the full churchyard and the
      empty wharves! He was paying dear for his princedom! And then, there was
      yet another sense of this beautiful town that I got here completely,
      suddenly crystallized, though slowly gathering ever since my arrival: all
      these old people were clustered about one young one. That was it; that was
      the town&rsquo;s ultimate tragic note: the old timber of the forest dying and
      the too sparse new growth appearing scantily amid the tall, fine,
      venerable, decaying trunks. It had been by no razing to the ground and
      sowing with salt that the city had perished; a process less violent but
      more sad had done away with it. Youth, in the wake of commerce, had ebbed
      from Kings Port, had flowed out from the silent, mourning houses, and
      sought life North and West, and wherever else life was to be found. Into
      my revery floated a phrase from a melodious and once favorite song: O
      tempo passato perche non ritorni?
    </p>
    <p>
      And John Mayrant? Why, then, had he tarried here himself? That is a hard
      saying about crabbed age and youth, but are not most of the sayings hard
      that are true? What was this young man doing in Kings Port with his
      brains, and his pride, and his energetic adolescence? If the Custom House
      galled him, the whole country was open to him; why not have tried his
      fortune out and away, over the hills, where the new cities lie, all full
      of future and empty of past? Was it much to the credit of such a young man
      to find himself at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four, sound and lithe
      of limb, yet tied to the apron strings of Miss Josephine, and Miss Eliza,
      and some thirty or forty other elderly female relatives?
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts I looked at the ladies and wondered how I might lead
      them to answer me about John Mayrant, without asking questions which might
      imply something derogatory to him or painful to them. I could not ever say
      to them a word which might mean, however indirectly, that I thought their
      beautiful, cherished town no place for a young man to go to seed in; this
      cut so close to the quick of truth that discourse must keep wide away from
      it. What, then, could I ask them? As I pondered, Mrs. Weguelin solved it
      for me by what she was saying to Mrs. Gregory, of which, in my
      preoccupation, I had evidently missed a part:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;if he should share the family bad taste in wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eliza says she has no fear of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I Eliza, Hugh&rsquo;s performance would make me very uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia, John does not resemble Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very decidedly, in coloring, Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Hugh found that girl in Minneapolis, Julia, where there was doubtless
      no pick for the poor fellow. And remember that George chose a lady, at any
      rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weguelin gave to this a short assent. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It portended something
      more behind, which her next words duly revealed. &ldquo;A lady; but do&mdash;any&mdash;ladies
      ever seem quite like our own?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You see, they were forgetting me again; but they had furnished me with a
      clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. John Mayrant has married brothers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Mrs. Gregory responded. &ldquo;John is the youngest of three children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard of the brothers before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seldom come here. They saw fit to leave their home and their
      delicate mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But John,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;met his responsibility like a Mayrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever temptations he has yielded to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weguelin, &ldquo;his filial
      piety has stood proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused,&rdquo; added Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;when George (and I have never
      understood how George could be so forgetful of their mother) wrote twice,
      offering him a lucrative and rising position in the railroad company at
      Roanoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was hard!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She totally misapplied my sympathy. &ldquo;Oh, Anna Mayrant,&rdquo; she corrected
      herself, &ldquo;John&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. Hector Mayrant, had harder things than
      forgetful sons to bear! I&rsquo;ve not laid eyes on those boys since the
      funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly two years,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Weguelin. And then, to me, with
      something that was almost like a strange severity beneath her gentle tone:
      &ldquo;Therefore we are proud of John, because the better traits in his nature
      remind us of his forefathers, whom we knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Kings Port,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory, &ldquo;we prize those who ring true to the
      blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By way of response to this sentiment, I quoted some French to her. &ldquo;Bon
      chien chasse de race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It pleased Mrs. Weguelin. Her guarded attitude toward me relented. &ldquo;John
      mentioned your cultivation to us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In these tumble-down days it
      is rare to meet with one who still lives, mentally, on the gentlefolks&rsquo; 
      plane&mdash;the piano nobile of intelligence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I realized how high a compliment she was paying me, and I repaid it with a
      joke. &ldquo;Take care. Those who don&rsquo;t live there would call it the piano
      snobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the delighted lady, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d never have the wit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;the Bostonian&rsquo;s remark&mdash;&lsquo;The
      mission of America is to vulgarize the world&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never expected to agree so totally with a Bostonian!&rdquo; declared Mrs.
      Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so hopeful,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;has ever been said of us. For refinement
      and thoroughness and tradition delay progress, and we are sweeping them
      out of the road as fast as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away, Julia,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gregory. &ldquo;The young gentleman is getting
      flippant again, and we leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies, after gracious expressions concerning the pleasure of their
      stroll, descended the steps at the north end of High Walk, where the
      parapet stops, and turned inland from the water through a little street. I
      watched them until they went out of my sight round a corner; but the two
      silent, leisurely figures, moving in their black and their veils along an
      empty highway, come back to me often in the pictures of my thoughts; come
      back most often, indeed, as the human part of what my memory sees when it
      turns to look at Kings Port. For, first, it sees the blue frame of quiet
      sunny water, and the white town within its frame beneath the clear,
      untainted air; and then it sees the high-slanted roofs, red with their old
      corrugated tiles, and the tops of leafy enclosures dipping below sight
      among quaint and huddled quadrangles; and, next, the quiet houses standing
      in their separate grounds, their narrow ends to the street and their long,
      two-storied galleries open to the south, but their hushed windows closed
      as if against the prying, restless Present that must not look in and
      disturb the motionless memories which sit brooding behind these shutters;
      and between all these silent mansions lie the narrow streets, the quiet,
      empty streets, along which, as my memory watches them, pass the two ladies
      silently, in their black and their veils, moving between high,
      mellow-colored garden walls over whose tops look the oleanders, the
      climbing roses, and all the taller flowers of the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Mrs. Gregory and Mrs. Weguelin seemed to me at moments as narrow as
      those streets, they also seemed to me as lovely as those serene gardens;
      and if I had smiled at their prejudices, I had loved their innocence,
      their deep innocence, of the poisoned age which has succeeded their own;
      and if I had wondered this day at their powers for cruelty, I wondered the
      next day at the glimpse I had of their kindness. For during a pelting cold
      rainstorm, as I sat and shivered in a Royal Street car, waiting for it to
      start upon its north-bound course, the house-door opposite which we stood
      at the end of the track opened, and Mrs. Weguelin&rsquo;s head appeared, nodding
      to the conductor as she sent her black servant out with hot coffee for
      him! He took off his hat, and smiled, and thanked her; and when we had
      started and I, the sole passenger in the chilly car, asked him about this,
      he said with native pride: &ldquo;The ladies always watches out for us
      conductors in stormy weather, sir. That&rsquo;s Mistress Weguelin St. Michael,
      one of our finest.&rdquo; And then he gave me careful directions how to find a
      shop that I was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of this happening in New York! Think of the aristocracy of that
      metropolis warming up with coffee the&mdash;but why think of it, or of a
      New York conductor answering your questions with careful directions! It is
      not New York&rsquo;s fault, it is merely New York&rsquo;s misfortune: New York is in a
      hurry; and a world of haste cannot be a world either of courtesy or of
      kindness. But we have progress, progress, instead; and that is a
      tremendous consolation.

      XI: Daddy Ben and His Seed
    </h2>
    <h3>
      But what was Hortense Rieppe coming to see for herself?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many dark things had been made plain to me by my talk with the two ladies;
      yet while disclosing so much, they had still left this important matter in
      shadow. I was very glad, however, for what they had revealed. They had
      showed me more of John Mayrant&rsquo;s character, and more also of the destiny
      which had shaped his ends, so that my esteem for him had increased; for
      some of the words that they had exchanged shone like bright lanterns down
      into his nature upon strength and beauty lying quietly there&mdash;young
      strength and beauty, yet already tempered by manly sacrifice. I saw how it
      came to pass through this, through renunciation of his own desires,
      through performance of duties which had fallen upon him not quite fairly,
      that the eye of his spirit had been turned away from self; thus had it
      grown strong-sighted and able to look far and deep, as his speech
      sometimes revealed, while still his flesh was of his youthful age, and no
      saint&rsquo;s flesh either. This had the ladies taught me during the fluttered
      interchange of their reminders and opinions, and by their eager agreements
      and disagreements, I was also grateful to them in that I could once more
      correct Juno. The pleasure should be mine to tell them in the public
      hearing of our table that Miss Rieppe was still engaged to John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was this interesting girl coming to see for herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      This little hole in my knowledge gave me discomfort as I walked along
      toward the antiquity shop where I was to buy the other kettle-supporter.
      The ladies, with all their freedom of comment and censure, had kept
      something from me. I reviewed, I pieced together, their various remarks,
      those oracles, especially, which they had let fall, but it all came back
      to the same thing. I did not know, and they did, what Hortense Rieppe was
      coming to see for herself. At all events, the engagement was not broken,
      the chance to be instrumental in having it broken was still mine; I might
      still save John Mayrant from his deplorable quixotism; and as this
      reflection grew with me I took increasing comfort in it, and I stepped
      onward toward my kettle-supporter, filled with that sense of moral
      well-being which will steal over even the humblest of us when we feel that
      we are beneficently minding somebody else&rsquo;s business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever the arrangement did not take me too widely from my course, I so
      mapped out my walks and errands in Kings Port that I might pass by the
      churchyard and church at the corner of Court and Worship streets. Even if
      I did not indulge myself by turning in to stroll and loiter among the
      flowers, it was enough pleasure to walk by that brick-wall. If you are
      willing to wander curiously in our old towns, you may still find in many
      of them good brick walls standing undisturbed, and equal in their color
      and simple excellence to those of Kings Port; but fashion has pushed these
      others out of its sight, among back streets and all sorts of forgotten
      purlieus and abandoned dignity, and takes its walks to-day amid cold,
      expensive ugliness; while the old brick walls of Kings Port continually
      frame your steps with charm. No one workman famous for his skill built
      them so well proportioned, so true to comeliness; it was the general hand
      of their age that could shape nothing wrong, as the hand of to-day can
      shape nothing right, save by a rigid following of the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave myself the pleasure this afternoon of walking by the churchyard
      wall; and when I reached the iron gate, there was Daddy Ben. So full was I
      of my thoughts concerning John Mayrant, and the vicissitudes of his heart,
      and the Custom House, that I was moved to have words with the old man upon
      the general topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and so Mr. John is going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No attempt to start a chat ever failed more signally. He assented with a
      manner of mingled civility and reserve that was perfection, and after the
      two syllables of which his answer consisted, he remained as impenetrably
      respectful as before. I felt rather high and dry, but I tried it again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure, Daddy Ben, that you feel as sorry as any of the family that
      the phosphates failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he replied with his two syllables of assent, and again he stood
      mute, respectful, a little bent with his great age; but now his good
      manners&mdash;and better manners were never seen&mdash;impelled him to
      break silence upon some subject, since he would not permit himself to
      speak concerning the one which I had introduced. It was the phosphates
      which inspired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey is mighty fine prostrate wukks heah, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been told so, Daddy Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On dis side up de ribber an&rsquo; tudder side down de ribber &lsquo;cross de new
      bridge. Wuth visitin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; strangers, sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I now felt entirely high and dry. I had attempted to enter into
      conversation with him about the intimate affairs of a family to which he
      felt that he belonged; and with perfect tact he had not only declined to
      discuss them with me, but had delicately informed me that I was a stranger
      and as such had better visit the phosphate works among the other sights of
      Kings Port. No diplomat could have done it better; and as I walled away
      from him I knew that he regarded me as an outsider, a Northerner,
      belonging to a race hostile to his people; he had seen Mas&rsquo; John friendly
      with me, but that was Mas&rsquo; John&rsquo;s affair. And so it was that if the ladies
      had kept something from me, this cunning, old, polite, coal-black African
      had kept everything from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      If all the negroes in Kings Port were like Daddy Ben, Mrs. Gregory St.
      Michael would not have spoken of having them &ldquo;to deal with,&rdquo; and the girl
      behind the counter would not have been thrown into such indignation when
      she alluded to their conceit and ignorance. Daddy Ben had, so far from
      being puffed up by the appointment in the Custom House, disapproved of
      this. I had heard enough about the difference between the old and new
      generations of the negro of Kings Port to believe it to be true, and I had
      come to discern how evidently it lay at the bottom of many things here:
      John Mayrant and his kind were a band united by a number of strong ties,
      but by nothing so much as by their hatred of the modern negro in their
      town. Yes, I was obliged to believe that the young Kings Port African left
      to freedom and the ballot, was a worse African than his slave parents; but
      this afternoon brought me a taste of it more pungent than all the
      assurances in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought my kettle-supporter, and learned from the robber who sold it to
      me (Kings Port prices for &ldquo;old things&rdquo; are the most exorbitant that I know
      anywhere) that a carpenter lived not far from Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s
      boarding-house, and that he would make for me the box in which I could
      pack my various purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, if he&rsquo;s working this week,&rdquo; added the robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else would he be doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be his week for getting drunk on what he earned the week before.&rdquo;
       And upon this he announced with as much bitterness as if he had been John
      Mayrant or any of his aunts, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Boston philanthropy has done for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dared up at this. &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s a Southern argument for
      reestablishing slavery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not Southern; Breslau is my native town, and I came from New York
      here to live five years ago. I&rsquo;ve seen what your emancipation has done for
      the black, and I say to you, my friend, honest I don&rsquo;t know a fool from a
      philanthropist any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had much right upon his side; and it can be seen daily that
      philanthropy does not always walk hand-in-hand with wisdom. Does anything
      or anybody always walk so? Moreover, I am a friend to not many
      superlatives, and have perceived no saying to be more true than the one
      that extremes meet: they meet indeed, and folly is their meeting-place.
      Nor could I say in the case of the negro which folly were the more
      ridiculous;&mdash;that which expects a race which has lived no one knows
      how many thousand years in mental nakedness while Confucius, Moses, and
      Napoleon were flowering upon adjacent human stems, should put on suddenly
      the white man&rsquo;s intelligence, or that other folly which declares we can do
      nothing for the African, as if Hampton had not already wrought excellent
      things for him. I had no mind to enter into all the inextricable error
      with this Teuton, and it was he who continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, these Boston philanthropists; oh, these know-it-alls! Why don&rsquo;t they
      stay home? Why do they come down here to worry us with their ignorance?
      See here, my friend, let me show you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed about his shop in a search of distraught eagerness, and with a
      multitude of small exclamations, until, screeching jubilantly once, he
      pounced upon a shabby and learned-looking volume. This he brought me,
      thrusting it with his trembling fingers between my own, and shuffling the
      open pages. But when the apparently right one was found, he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;No, I have better! and dashed away to a pile of pamphlets on the floor,
      where he began to plough and harrow. Wondering if I was closeted with a
      maniac, I looked at the book in my passive hand, and saw diagrams of
      various bones to me unknown, and men&rsquo;s names of which I was equally
      ignorant&mdash;Mivart, Topinard, and more,&mdash;but at last that of
      Huxley. But this agreeable sight was spoiled at once by the quite horrible
      words Nycticebidoe, platyrrhine, catarrhine, from which I raised my eyes
      to see him coming at me with two pamphlets, and scolding as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you educated, yes? Have been to college, yes? Then perhaps you will
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly I understood immediately that he and his pamphlets were as bad
      as the book, or worse, in their use of a vocabulary designed to cause
      almost any listener the gravest inconvenience. Common Eocene ancestors
      occurred at the beginning of his lecture; and I believed that if it got no
      stronger than this, I could at least preserve the appearance of
      comprehending him; but it got stronger, and at sacro-iliac notch I may
      say, without using any grossly exaggerated expression, that I became
      unconscious. At least, all intelligence left me. When it returned, he was
      saying.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is only the beginning. Come in here to my crania and jaws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently he held me hypnotized, for he now hurried me unresisting through
      a back door into a dark little where he turned up the gas, and I saw
      shelves as in a museum, to one of which he led me. I suppose that it was
      curiosity that rendered me thus sheep-like. Upon the shelf were a number
      of skulls and jaws in admirable condition and graded arrangement,
      beginning to the left with that flat kind of skull which one associates
      with gorillas. He resumed his scolding harangue, and for a few brief
      moments I understood him. Here, told by themselves, was as much of the
      story of the skulls as we know, from manlike apes through glacial man to
      the modern senator or railroad president. But my intelligence was destined
      soon to die away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the Caucasian skull: your skull,&rdquo; he said, touching a specimen at
      the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I know nothing about skulls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shall know someding before you leave,&rdquo; he retorted, wagging his
      head at me; and this time it was not the book, but a specimen, that he
      pushed into my grasp. He gave it a name, not as bad as platyrrhine, but I
      feared worse was coming; then he took it away from me, gave me another
      skull, and while I obediently held it, pronounced something quite beyond
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the translation of that?&rdquo; he demanded excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I feebly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shouted with overweening triumph: &ldquo;The translation of that is South
      Carolina nigger. Notice well this so egcellent specimen. Prognathous,
      megadont, platyrrhine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Platyrrhine!&rdquo; I saluted the one word I recognized as I drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it yourself!&rdquo; was his extraordinary answer;&mdash;for what
      had I said? Almost as if he were going to break into a dance for joy, he
      took the Caucasian skull and the other two, and set the three together by
      themselves, away from the rest of the collection. The picture which they
      thus made spoke more than all the measurements and statistics which he now
      chattered out upon me, reading from his book as I contemplated the skulls.
      There was a similarity of shape, a kinship there between the three, which
      stared you in the face; but in the contours of vaulted skull, the
      projecting jaws, and the great molar teeth&mdash;what was to be seen? Why,
      in every respect that the African departed from the Caucasian, he departed
      in the direction of the ape! Here was zoology mutely but eloquently
      telling us why there had blossomed no Confucius, no Moses, no Napoleon,
      upon that black stem; why no Iliad, no Parthenon, no Sistine Madonna, had
      ever risen from that tropic mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collector touched my sleeve. &ldquo;Have you now learned someding about
      skulls, my friend? Will you invite those Boston philanthropists to stay
      home? They will get better results in civilization by giving votes to
      monkeys than teaching Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to riggers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Retaliation rose in me. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you learned to call them negroes?&rdquo; I
      remarked. But this was lost upon the Teuton. I was tempted to tell him
      that I was no philanthropist, and no Bostonian, and that he need not shout
      so loud, but my more dignified instincts restrained me. I withdrew my
      sleeve from his touch (it was this act of his, I think, that had most to
      do with my displeasure), and merely bidding him observe that the enormous
      price of the kettle-supporter had been reduced for me by his exhibition to
      a bagatelle, I left the shop of the screaming anatomist&mdash;or Afropath,
      or whatever it may seem most fitting that he should be called.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bore the kettle-supporter with me, tied up objectionably in newspaper,
      and knotted with ungainly string; and it was this bundle which prevented
      my joining the girl behind the counter, and ending by a walk with a young
      lady the afternoon that had begun by a walk with two old ones. I should
      have liked to make my confession to her. She was evidently out for the
      sake of taking the air, and had with her no companion save the big curly
      white dog; confession would have been very agreeable; but I looked again
      at my ugly newspaper bundle, and turned in a direction that she was not
      herself pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice, as I went, I broke into laughter over my interview in the shop,
      which I fear has lost its comical quality in the relating. To enter a door
      and come serenely in among dingy mahogany and glass objects, to bargain
      haughtily for a brass bauble with the shopkeeper, and to have a few
      exchanged remarks suddenly turn the whole place into a sort of bedlam with
      a gibbering scientist dashing skulls at me to prove his fixed idea, and
      myself quite furious&mdash;I laughed more than twice; but, by the time I
      had approached the neighborhood of the carpenter&rsquo;s shop, another side of
      it had brought reflection to my mind. Here was a foreigner to whom slavery
      and the Lost Cause were nothing, whose whole association with the South
      had begun but five years ago; and the race question had brought his
      feelings to this pitch! He had seen the Kings Port negro with the eyes of
      the flesh, and not with the eyes of theory, and as a result the reddest
      rag for him was pale beside a Boston philanthropist!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I have said already that I am no lover of superlatives, and
      in doctrine especially is this true. We need not expect a Confucius from
      the negro, nor yet a Chesterfield; but I am an enemy also of that blind
      and base hate against him, which conducts nowhere save to the
      de-civilizing of white and black alike. Who brought him here? Did he
      invite himself? Then let us make the best of it and teach him, lead him,
      compel him to live self-respecting, not as statesman, poet, or financier,
      but by the honorable toil of his hand and sweat of his brow. Because &ldquo;the
      door of hope&rdquo; was once opened too suddenly for him is no reason for
      slamming it now forever in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus mentally I lectured back at the Teuton as I went through the streets
      of Kings Port; and after a while I turned a corner which took me abruptly,
      as with one magic step, out of the white man&rsquo;s world into the blackest
      Congo. Even the well-inhabited quarter of Kings Port (and I had now come
      within this limited domain) holds narrow lanes and recesses which teem and
      swarm with negroes. As cracks will run through fine porcelain, so do these
      black rifts of Africa lurk almost invisible among the gardens and the
      houses. The picture that these places offered, tropic, squalid, and
      fecund, often caused me to walk through them and watch the basking
      population; the intricate, broken wooden galleries, the rickety outside
      stair cases, the red and yellow splashes of color on the clothes lines,
      the agglomerate rags that stuffed holes in decaying roofs or hung nakedly
      on human frames, the small, choked dwellings, bursting open at doors and
      windows with black, round-eyed babies as an overripe melon bursts with
      seeds, the children playing marbles in the court, the parents playing
      cards in the room, the grandparents smoking pipes on the porch, and the
      great-grandparents stairs gazing out at you like creatures from the Old
      Testament or the jungle. From the jungle we had stolen them, North and
      South had stolen them together, long ago, to be slaves, not to be
      citizens, and now here they were, the fruits of our theft; and for some
      reason (possibly the Teuton was the reason) that passage from the Book of
      Exodus came into my head: &ldquo;For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
      visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts were interrupted by sounds as of altercation. I had nearly
      reached the end of the lane, where I should again emerge into the White
      man&rsquo;s world, and where I was now walking the lane spread into a broader
      space with ells and angles and rotting steps, and habitations mostly too
      ruinous to be inhabited. It was from a sashless window in one of these
      that the angry voices came. The first words which were distinct aroused my
      interest quite beyond the scale of an ordinary altercation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calls you&rsquo;self a reconstuckted niggah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said sharply and with prodigious scorn. The answer which it
      brought was lengthy and of such a general sullen incoherence that I could
      make out only a frequent repetition of &ldquo;custom house,&rdquo; and that somebody
      was going to take care of somebody hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this the first voice broke with tones of highest contempt and
      rapidity:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;President gwine to gib brekfus&rsquo; an&rsquo; dinnah an suppah to de likes ob you
      fo&rsquo; de whole remaindah oh youh wuthless nat&rsquo;ral life? Get out ob my sight,
      you reconstuckted niggah. I come out oh de St. Michael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came through the window immediately upon this sounds of scuffling
      and of a fall, and then cries for help which took me running into the
      dilapidated building. Daddy Ben lay on the floor, and a thick, young
      savage was kicking him. In some remarkable way I thought of the solidity
      of their heads, and before the assailant even knew that he had a witness,
      I sped forward, aiming my kettle-supporter, and with its sharp brass edge
      I dealt him a crack over his shin with astonishing accuracy. It was a
      dismal howl that he gave, and as he turned he got from me another crack
      upon the other shin. I had no time to be alarmed at my deed, or I think
      that I should have been very much so; I am a man above all of peace, and
      physical encounters are peculiarly abhorrent to me; but, so far from
      assailing me, the thick, young savage, with the single muttered remark,
      &ldquo;He hit me fuss,&rdquo; got himself out of the house with the most agreeable
      rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daddy Ben sat up, and his first inquiry greatly reassured me as to his
      state. He stared at my paper bundle. &ldquo;You done make him hollah wid dat,
      sah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I showed him the kettle-supporter through a rent in its wrapping, and I
      assisted him to stand upright. His injuries proved fortunately to be
      slight (although I may say here that the shock to his ancient body kept
      him away for a few days from the churchyard), and when I began to talk to
      him about the incident, he seemed unwilling to say much in answer to my
      questions. And when I offered to accompany him to where he lived, he
      declined altogether, assuring me that it was close, and that he could walk
      there as well as if nothing had happened to him; but upon my asking him if
      I was on the right way to the carpenter&rsquo;s shop, he looked at me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use you gwine dab, sah. Dat shop close up. He not wukkin, dis week,
      and dat why fo&rsquo; I jaw him jus&rsquo; now when you come in an&rsquo; stop him. He de
      cahpentah, my gran&rsquo;son, Cha&rsquo;s Coteswuth.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XII: From the Bedside
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning when I saw the weltering sky I resigned myself to a day of
      dullness; yet before its end I had caught a bright new glimpse of John
      Mayrant&rsquo;s abilities, and also had come, through tribulation, to a further
      understanding of the South; so that I do not, to-day, regret the
      tribulation. As the rain disappointed me of two outdoor expeditions, to
      which I had been for some little while looking forward, I dedicated most
      of my long morning to a sadly neglected correspondence, and trusted that
      the expeditions, as soon as the next fine weather visited Kings Port,
      would still be in store for me. Not only everybody in town here, but Aunt
      Carola, up in the North also, had assured me that to miss the sight of
      Live Oaks when the azaleas in the gardens of that country seat were in
      flower would be to lose one of the rarest and most beautiful things which
      could be seen anywhere; and so I looked out of my window at the furious
      storm, hoping that it might not strip the bushes at Live Oaks of their
      bloom, which recent tourists at Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s had described as drawing
      near the zenith of its luxuriance. The other excursion to Udolpho with
      John Mayrant was not so likely to fall through. Udolpho was a sort of
      hunting lodge or country club near Tern Creek and an old colonial church,
      so old that it bore the royal arms upon a shield still preserved as a sign
      of its colonial origin. A note from Mayrant, received at breakfast,
      informed me that the rain would take all pleasure from such an excursion,
      and that he should seize the earliest opportunity the weather might afford
      to hold me to my promise. The wet gale, even as I sat writing, was beating
      down some of the full-blown flowers in the garden next Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s
      house, and as the morning wore on I watched the paths grow more strewn
      with broken twigs and leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I filled my correspondence with accounts of Daddy Ben and his grandson,
      the carpenter, doubtless from some pride in my part in that, but also
      because it had become, through thinking it over, even more interesting
      to-day than it had been at the moment of its occurrence; and in replying
      to a sort of postscript of Aunt Carola&rsquo;s in which she hurriedly wrote that
      she had forgotten to say she had heard the La Heu family in South Carolina
      was related to the Bombos, and should be obliged to me if I would make
      inquiries about this, I told her that it would be easy, and then described
      to her the Teuton, plying his &ldquo;antiquity&rdquo; trade externally while
      internally cherishing his collected skulls and nursing his scientific
      rage. All my letters were the more abundant concerning these adventures of
      mine from my having kept entirely silent upon them at Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s
      tea-table. I dreaded Juno when let loose upon the negro question; and the
      fact that I was beginning to understand her feelings did not at all make
      me wish to be deafened by them. Neither Juno, therefore, nor any of them
      learned a word from me about the kettle-supporter incident. What I did
      take pains to inform the assembled company was my gratification that the
      report of Mr. Mayrant&rsquo;s engagement being broken was unfounded; and this
      caused Juno to observe that in that case Miss Rieppe must have the most
      imperative reasons for uniting herself to such a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unintimidated by the rain, this formidable creature had taken herself off
      to her nephew&rsquo;s bedside almost immediately after breakfast; and later in
      the day I, too, risked a drenching for the sake of ordering the
      packing-box that I needed. When I returned, it was close on tea-time; I
      had seen Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael send out the hot coffee to the
      conductor, and I had found a negro carpenter whose week it happily was to
      stay sober; and now I learned that, when tea should be finished, the
      poetess had in store for us, as a treat, her ode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our evening meal was not plain sailing, even for the veteran navigation of
      Mrs. Trevise; Juno had returned from the bedside very plainly displeased
      (she was always candid even when silent) by something which had happened
      there; and before the joyful moment came when we all learned what this
      was, a very gouty Boston lady who had arrived with her husband from
      Florida on her way North&mdash;and whose nature you will readily grasp
      when I tell you that we found ourselves speaking of the man as Mrs.
      Braintree&rsquo;s husband and never as Mr. Braintree&mdash;this crippled lady,
      who was of a candor equal to Juno&rsquo;s, embarked upon a conversation with
      Juno that compelled Mrs. Trevise to tinkle her bell for Daphne after only
      two remarks had been exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been sorry at first that here in this Southern boarding-house Boston
      should be represented only by a lady who appeared to unite in herself all
      the stony products of that city, and none of the others; for she was as
      convivial as a statue and as well-informed as a spelling-book; she stood
      no more for the whole of Boston than did Juno for the whole of Kings Port.
      But my sorrow grew less when I found that in Mrs. Braintree we had indeed
      a capable match for her Southern counterpart. Juno, according to her
      custom, had remembered something objectionable that had been perpetrated
      in 1865 by the Northern vandals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; said Mrs. Braintree to her husband, in a frightfully clear
      voice, &ldquo;it was at Chambersburg, was it not, that the Southern vandals
      burned the house in which were your father&rsquo;s title-deeds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edward, who, it appeared, had fought through the whole Civil War, and was
      in consequence perfectly good-humored and peaceable in his feelings upon
      that subject, replied hastily and amiably: &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes! Why, I believe
      it was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this availed nothing; Juno bent her great height forward, and
      addressed Mrs. Braintree. &ldquo;This is the first time I have been told
      Southerners were vandals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never be able to say that again!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Braintree.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the bell and Daphne had stopped, the invaluable Briton addressed a
      genial generalization to us all: &ldquo;I often think how truly awful your war
      would have been if the women had fought it, y&rsquo;know, instead of the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; said the easy-going Edward &ldquo;Squaws! Mutilation! Yes!&rdquo; and he
      laughed at his little joke, but he laughed alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Juno. &ldquo;Speaking of mutilation, I trust your nephew is better
      this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was rejoiced by receiving a glare in response. But still more joy was to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apology ought to help cure him a lot,&rdquo; observed the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno employed her policy of not hearing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I trust that your nephew is in less pain,&rdquo; said the poetess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juno was willing to answer this. &ldquo;The injuries, thank you, are the merest
      trifles&mdash;all that such a light-weight could inflict.&rdquo; And she
      shrugged her shoulders to indicate the futility of young John&rsquo;s pugilism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; the surprised Briton interposed, &ldquo;I thought you said your nephew
      was too feeble to eat steak or hear poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juno could always stem the eddy of her own contradictions&mdash;but she
      did raise her voice a little. &ldquo;I fancy, sir, that Doctor Beaugarcon knows
      what he is talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they apologized yet?&rdquo; inquired the male honeymooner from the
      up-country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephew, sir, nobly consented to shake hands this afternoon. He did it
      entirely out of respect for Mr. Mayrant&rsquo;s family, who coerced him into
      this tardy reparation, and who feel unable to recognize him since his
      treasonable attitude in the Custom House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be fairly hard to coerce a chap you can&rsquo;t recognize,&rdquo; said the
      Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      An et cetera now spoke to the honeymoon bride from the up-country: &ldquo;I
      heard Doctor Beaugarcon say he was coming to visit you this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yais,&rdquo; assented the bride. &ldquo;Doctor Beaugarcon is my mother&rsquo;s fourth
      cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juno now took&mdash;most unwisely, as it proved&mdash;a vindictive turn at
      me. &ldquo;I knew that your friend, Mr. Mayrant, was intemperate,&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think that Mrs. Trevise had any intention to ring for Daphne at
      this point&mdash;her curiosity was too lively; but Juno was going to risk
      no such intervention, and I saw her lay a precautionary hand heavily down
      over the bell. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I did not know that Mr. Mayrant was
      a gambler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen him intemperate?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be quite needless,&rdquo; Juno returned. &ldquo;And of the gambling I have
      ocular proof, since I found him, cards, counters, and money, with my sick
      nephew. He had actually brought cards in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the Briton, &ldquo;your nephew was too sick to resist him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The male honeymooner, with two of the et ceteras, made such unsteady
      demonstrations at this that Mrs. Trevise protracted our sitting no longer.
      She rose, and this meant rising for us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of regret and incompleteness filled me, and finding the Briton at
      my elbow as our company proceeded toward the sitting room, I said: &ldquo;Too
      bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His whisper was confident. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the rest of it out of her yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the rest of it came without our connivance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sitting room Doctor Beaugarcon sat waiting, and at sight of Juno
      entering the door (she headed our irregular procession) he sprang up and
      lifted admiring hands. &ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t I have an aunt like you!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, and to Mrs. Trevise as she followed: &ldquo;She pays her nephew&rsquo;s
      poker debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much, cousin Tom?&rdquo; asked the upcountry bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the gay old doctor chuckled, as he kissed her: &ldquo;Thirty dollars this
      afternoon, my darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the Briton dragged me behind a door in the hall, and there we
      danced together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Mayrant chap will do,&rdquo; he declared; and we composed ourselves for a
      proper entrance into the sitting room, where the introductions had been
      made, and where Doctor Beaugarcon and Mrs. Braintree&rsquo;s husband had already
      fallen into war reminiscences, and were discovering with mutual amiability
      that they had fought against each other in a number of battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you generally licked us,&rdquo; smiled the Union soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t I know myself how it feels to run!&rdquo; laughed the Confederate.
      &ldquo;Are you down at the club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But upon learning from the poetess that her ode was now to be read aloud,
      Doctor Beaugarcon paid his fourth cousin&rsquo;s daughter a brief, though
      affectionate, visit, lamenting that a very ill patient should compel him
      to take himself away so immediately, but promising her presently in his
      stead two visitors much more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Josephine St. Michael desires to call upon you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
      fancy that her nephew will escort her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all this rain?&rdquo; said the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s letting up, letting up! Good night, Mistress Trevise. Good
      night, sir; I am glad to have met you.&rdquo; He shook hands with Mrs.
      Braintree&rsquo;s husband. &ldquo;We fellows,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;who fought in the war
      have had war enough.&rdquo; And bidding the general company good night, and
      kissing the bride again, he left us even as the poetess returned from her
      room with the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon wished that I had escaped with him, because I feared what Mrs.
      Braintree might say when the verses should be finished; and so, I think,
      did her husband. We should have taken the hint which tactful Doctor
      Beaugarcon had meant, I began to believe, to give us in that whispered
      remark of his. But it had been given too lightly, and so we sat and heard
      the ode out. I am sure that the poetess, wrapped in the thoughts of her
      own composition, had lost sight of all but the phrasing of her poem and
      the strong feelings which it not unmusically voiced; there Is no other way
      to account for her being willing to read it in Mrs. Braintree&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever gayety had filled me when the Boston lady had clashed with Juno
      was now changed to deprecation and concern. Indeed, I myself felt almost
      as if I were being physically struck by the words, until mere bewilderment
      took possession of me; and after bewilderment, a little, a very little,
      light, which, however, rapidly increased. We were the victors, we the
      North, and we had gone upon our way with songs and rejoicing&mdash;able to
      forget, because we were the victors. We had our victory; let the
      vanquished have their memory. But here was the cry of the vanquished,
      coming after forty years. It was the time which at first bewildered me;
      Juno had seen the war, Juno&rsquo;s bitterness I could comprehend, even if I
      could not comprehend her freedom in expressing it, but the poetess could
      not be more than a year or two older than I was; she had come after it was
      all over. Why should she prolong such memories and feelings? But my light
      increased as I remembered she had not written this for us, and that if she
      had not seen the flames of war, she had seen the ashes; for the ashes I
      had seen myself here in Kings Port, and had been overwhelmed by the sight,
      forty years later, more overwhelmed than I could possibly say to Mrs.
      Gregory St. Michael, or Mrs. Weguelin, or anybody. The strain of sitting
      and waiting for the end made my hands cold and my head hot, but
      nevertheless the light which had come enabled me to bend instantly to Mrs.
      Braintree and murmur a great and abused quotation to her:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Tout comprendre c&rsquo;est tout pardonner.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But my petition could not move her. She was too old; she had seen the
      flames of war; and so she said to her husband:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward, will you please help me upstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus the lame, irreconcilable lady left the room with the assistance
      of her unhappy warrior, who must have suffered far more keenly than I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      This departure left us all in a constraint which was becoming unbearable
      when the blessed doorbell rang and delivered us, and Miss Josephine St.
      Michael entered with John Mayrant. He wore a most curious expression; his
      eyes went searching about the room, and at length settled upon Juno with a
      light in them as impish as that which had flickered in my own mood before
      the ode.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, Miss Josephine advanced and gave me a special and marked
      greeting. Before this she had always merely bowed to me; to-night she held
      out her hand. &ldquo;Of course my visit is not to you; but I am very glad to
      find you here and express the appreciation of several of us for your
      timely aid to Daddy Ben. He feels much shame in having said nothing to you
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while I muttered those inevitable modest nothings which fit such
      occasions, Miss St. Michael recounted to the bride, whom she was
      ostensibly calling upon, and to the rest of our now once more harmonious
      circle, my adventures in the alleys of Africa. These loomed, even with
      Miss St. Michael&rsquo;s perfectly quiet and simple rendering of them, almost of
      heroic size, thanks doubtless to Daddy Ben&rsquo;s tropical imagery when he
      first told the tale; and before they were over Miss St. Michael&rsquo;s marked
      recognition of me actually brought from Juno some reflected recognition&mdash;only
      this resembled in its graciousness the original about as correctly as a
      hollow spoon reflects the human countenance divine. Still, it was at
      Juno&rsquo;s own request that I brought down from my chamber and displayed to
      them the kettle-supporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that Miss St. Michael&rsquo;s visit was ostensibly to the bride: and
      that is because for some magnetic reason or other I felt diplomacy like an
      undercurrent passing among our chairs. Young John&rsquo;s expression deepened,
      whenever he watched Juno, to a devilishness which his polite manners
      veiled no better than a mosquito netting; and I believe that his aunt, on
      account of the battle between their respective nephews, had for family
      reasons deemed it advisable to pay, indirectly, under cover of the bride,
      a state visit to Juno; and I think that I saw Juno accepting it as a state
      visit, and that the two together, without using a word of spoken language,
      gave each other to understand that the recent deplorable circumstances
      were a closed incident. I think that his Aunt Josephine had desired young
      John to pay a visit likewise, and, to make sure of his speedy compliance,
      had brought him along with her&mdash;coerced him, as Juno would have said.
      He wore somewhat the look of having been &ldquo;coerced,&rdquo; and he contributed
      remarkably few observations to the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all harmonious, and decorous, and properly conducted, this state
      visit; yet even so, Juno and John exchanged at parting some verbal
      sweet-meats which rather stuck out from the smooth meringue of diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She contemplated his bruise. &ldquo;You are feeling stronger, I hope, than you
      have been lately? A bridegroom&rsquo;s health should be good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her. &ldquo;I am feeling better to-night than for many weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rascal had the thirty dollars visibly bulging that moment in his
      pocket. I doubt if he had acquainted his aunt with this episode, but she
      was certain to hear it soon; and when she did hear it, I rather fancy that
      she wished to smile&mdash;as I completely smiled alone in my bed that
      night thinking young John over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not go to sleep smiling; listening to the &ldquo;Ode for the Daughters
      of Dixie&rdquo; had been an ordeal too truly painful, because it disclosed live
      feelings which I had thought were dead, or rather, it disclosed that those
      feelings smouldered in the young as well as in the old. Doctor Beaugarcon
      didn&rsquo;t have them&mdash;he had fought them out, just as Mr. Braintree had
      fought them out; and Mrs. Braintree, like Juno, retained them, because she
      hadn&rsquo;t fought them out; and John Mayrant didn&rsquo;t have them, because he had
      been to other places; and I didn&rsquo;t have them&mdash;never had had them in
      my life, because I came into the world when it was all over. Why then&mdash;Stop,
      I told myself, growing very wakeful, and seeing in the darkness the light
      which had come to me, you have beheld the ashes, and even the sight has
      overwhelmed you; these others were born in the ashes, and have had ashes
      to sleep in and ashes to eat. This I said to myself; and I remembered that
      War hadn&rsquo;t been all; that Reconstruction came in due season; and I thought
      of the &ldquo;reconstructed&rdquo; negro, as Daddy Ben had so ingeniously styled him.
      These white people, my race, had been set beneath the reconstructed negro.
      Still, still, this did not justify the whole of it to me; my perfectly
      innocent generation seemed to be included in the unforgiving, unforgetting
      ode. &ldquo;I must have it out with somebody,&rdquo; I said. And in time I fell
      asleep.

      XIII: The Girl Behind the Counter&mdash;III
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was still thinking the ode over as I dressed for breakfast, for which I
      was late, owing to my hair, which the changes in the weather had rendered
      somewhat recalcitrant. Yes; decidedly I must have it out with somebody.
      The weather was once more superb; and in the garden beneath my window men
      were already sweeping away the broken twigs and debris of the storm. I say
      &ldquo;already,&rdquo; because it had not seemed to me to be the Kings Port custom to
      remove debris, or anything, with speed. I also had it in my mind to
      perform at lunch Aunt Carola&rsquo;s commission, and learn if the family of La
      Heu were indeed of royal descent through the Bombos. I intended to find
      this out from the girl behind the counter, but the course which our
      conversation took led me completely to forget about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I entered the Exchange I planted myself in front of the
      counter, in spite of the discouragement which I too plainly perceived in
      her countenance; the unfavorable impression which I had made upon her at
      our last interview was still in force.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plunged into it at once. &ldquo;I have a confession to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me surprising honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now, don&rsquo;t begin like that! I suppose you never told a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth now when I say that I do not see why an entire
      stranger should confess anything to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness! Well, I told you a lie, anyhow; a great, successful,
      deplorable lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her mouth under the shock of it, and I recited to her
      unsparingly my deception; during this recital her mouth gradually closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare, declare, declare!&rdquo; she slowly and deliciously breathed
      over the sum total; and she considered me at length, silently, before her
      words came again, like a soft soliloquy. &ldquo;I could never have believed it
      in one who&rdquo;&mdash;here gayety flashed in her eyes suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;parts
      his back hair so rigidly. Oh, I beg your pardon for being personal!&rdquo; And
      her gayety broke in ripples. Some habitual instinct moved me to turn to
      the looking-glass. &ldquo;Useless!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t see it in that. But
      it&rsquo;s perfectly splendid to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nature has been kind to me in many ways&mdash;nay, prodigal; it is not
      every man who can perceive the humor in a jest of which he is himself the
      subject. I laughed with her. &ldquo;I trust that I am forgiven,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you are forgiven! Come out, General, and give the gentleman your
      right paw, and tell him that he is forgiven&mdash;if only for the sake of
      Daddy Ben.&rdquo; With these latter words she gave me a gracious nod of
      understanding. They were all thanking me for the kettle-supporter! She
      probably knew also the tale of John Mayrant, the cards, and the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curly dog came out, and went through his part very graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess his last name,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General&rsquo;s? How? Oh, you&rsquo;ve heard it! I don&rsquo;t believe in you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bit handsome, after my confession. No, I&rsquo;m getting to
      understand South Carolina a little. You came from the &lsquo;up-country,&rsquo; you
      call your dog General; his name is General Hampton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her laughter assented. &ldquo;Tell me some more about South Carolina,&rdquo; she added
      with her caressing insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to begin with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go sit down at your lunch-table first. Aunt Josephine would never
      tolerate my encouraging gentlemen to talk to me over the counter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went back obediently, and then resumed: &ldquo;Well, what sort of people are
      those who own the handsome garden behind Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; that&rsquo;s all I wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re new people. I could tell it from the way you stuck your nose in
      the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you talk about my hair, I can talk about your nose, I think. I
      suspected that they were: &lsquo;new people&rsquo; because they cleaned up their
      garden immediately after the storm this morning. Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you
      something else: the whole South looks down on the whole North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made her voice kind. &ldquo;Do you mind it very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I joined in her latent mirth. &ldquo;It makes life not worth living! But more
      than this, South Carolina looks down on the whole South.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Virginia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? An &lsquo;entire stranger,&rsquo; you know, sometimes notices things which
      escape the family eye&mdash;family likenesses in the children, for
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never Virginia,&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very well! Somehow you&rsquo;ve admitted the rest, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And next, Kings Port looks down on all the rest of South Carolina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She now laughed outright. &ldquo;An up-country girl will not deny that, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And finally, your aunts&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunts are Kings Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the thirty thousand negroes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there are other white people here&mdash;there goes your nose again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not have you so impudent, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, I&rsquo;m on my knees. But your aunts&mdash;&rdquo; There was
      such a flash of war in her eye that I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not even mention them?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly upon this she became serious and gentle. &ldquo;I thought that you
      understood them. Would you take them from their seclusion, too? It is all
      they have left&mdash;since you burned the rest in 1865.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had made her say what I wanted! That &ldquo;you&rdquo; was what I wanted. Now I
      should presently have it out with her. But, for the moment, I did not
      disclaim the &ldquo;you.&rdquo; I said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The burning in 1865 was horrible, but it was war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the same kind as England&rsquo;s, who burned Washington in 1812, and whom
      you all so deeply admire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had, it seemed, no answer to this. But we trembled on the verge of a
      real quarrel. It was in her voice when she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I interrupted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pushed the risk one step nearer the verge, because of the words I wished
      finally to reach. &ldquo;In 1812, when England burned our White House down, we
      did not sit in the ashes; we set about rebuilding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now she burst out. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair, that&rsquo;s perfectly inexcusable! Did
      England then set loose on us a pack of black savages and politicians to
      help us rebuild? Why, this very day I cannot walk on the other side of the
      river, I dare not venture off the New Bridge; and you who first beat us
      and then unleashed the blacks to riot in a new &lsquo;equality&rsquo; that they were
      no more fit for than so many apes, you sat back at ease in your victory
      and your progress, having handed the vote to the negro as you might have
      handed a kerosene lamp to a child of three, and let us crushed, breathless
      people cope with the chaos and destruction that never came near you. Why,
      how can you dare&mdash;&rdquo; Once again, admirably she pulled herself up as
      she had done when she spoke of the President. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she declared,
      half whispering, and then more clearly and calmly, &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And she
      shook her head as if shaking something off. &ldquo;Nor must you,&rdquo; she finished,
      charmingly and quietly, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; I assured her. She was truly noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did think that you understood us,&rdquo; she said pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss La Heu, when you talked to me about the President and the White
      House, I said that you were hard to answer. Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. I said I was glad you found me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You helped me to understand you then, and now I want to be helped to
      further understanding. Last night I heard the &lsquo;Ode for the Daughters of
      Dixie.&rsquo; I had a bad time listening to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you presume to criticise it? Do we criticise your Grand Army reunions,
      and your &lsquo;Marching through Georgia,&rsquo; and your &lsquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Body,&rsquo; and
      your Arlington Museum? Can we not be allowed to celebrate our heroes and
      our glories and sing our songs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had helped me already! Still, still, the something I was groping for,
      the something which had given me such pain during the ode, remained
      undissolved, remained unanalyzed between us; I still had to have it out
      with her, and the point was that it had to be with her, and not simply
      with myself alone. We must thrash out together the way to an
      understanding; an agreement was not in the least necessary&mdash;we could
      agree to differ, for that matter, with perfect cordiality&mdash;but an
      understanding we must reach. And as I was thinking this my light
      increased, and I saw clearly the ultimate thing which lay at the bottom of
      my own feeling, and which had been strangely confusing me all along. This
      discovery was the key to the whole remainder of my talk; I never let go of
      it. The first thing it opened for me was that Eliza La Heu didn&rsquo;t
      understand me, which was quite natural, since I had only just this moment
      become clear to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many of us,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;who have watched the soiling touch of politics
      make dirty one clean thing after another, would not be wholly desolated to
      learn that the Grand Army of the Republic had gone to another world to
      sing its songs and draw its pensions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked astonished, and then she laughed. Down in the South here she
      was too far away to feel the vile uses to which present politics had
      turned past heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t any Daughters of the Union banded together
      and handing it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Well, if the deeds of your heroes are not a sacred
      trust to you, don&rsquo;t invite us, please, to resemble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited for more, and a little more came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We consider Northerners foreigners, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I felt that hurt which hearing the ode had given me, but I now knew
      how I was going to take it, and where we were presently coming out; and I
      knew she didn&rsquo;t mean quite all that&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean it every day, at
      least&mdash;and that my speech had driven her to saying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss La Heu; you don&rsquo;t consider Northerners, who understand you, to
      be foreigners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have never met any of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;but you really want to. Didn&rsquo;t you say you hoped I was
      one? Away down deep there&rsquo;s a cry of kinship in you; and that you don&rsquo;t
      hear it, and that we don&rsquo;t hear it, has been as much our fault as yours. I
      see that very well now, but I&rsquo;m afraid to tell you so, yet.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      What I said was: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re handing the &lsquo;sacred trust&rsquo; down, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood you to say you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said we were not handing &lsquo;it&rsquo; down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t wonder that irritation again moulded her reply. &ldquo;You must excuse
      a daughter of Dixie if she finds the words of a son of the Union beyond
      her. We haven&rsquo;t had so many advantages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she touched what I had thought over during my wakeful hours: the
      tale of the ashes, the desolate ashes! The war had not prevented my
      parents from sending me to school and college, but here the old had seen
      the young grow up starved of what their fathers had given them, and the
      young had looked to the old and known their stripped heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss La Heu,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I could not tell you, you would not wish me to
      tell you, what the sight of Kings Port has made me feel. But you will let
      me say this: I have understood for a long while about your old people,
      your old ladies, whose faces are so fine and sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused, but she merely looked at me, and her eyes were hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I may say this, too. I thank you very sincerely for bringing
      completely home to me what I had begun to make out for myself. I hope the
      Daughters of Dixie will go on singing of their heroes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused again, and now she looked away, out of the window into Royal
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I still continued, &ldquo;you will hardly believe me when I say that
      I have looked at your monuments here with an emotion more poignant even
      than that which Northern monuments raise in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Need you have asked that? The North won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite dispassionate!&rdquo; Her eyes were always toward the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my &lsquo;sacred trust.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It made her look at me. &ldquo;Yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yours&mdash;yet! It would be yours if you had won.&rdquo; I thought a
      slight change came in her steady scrutiny. &ldquo;And, Miss La Heu, it was awful
      about the negro. It is awful. The young North thinks so just as much as
      you do. Oh, we shock our old people! We don&rsquo;t expect them to change, but
      they mustn&rsquo;t expect us not to. And even some of them have begun to whisper
      a little doubtfully. But never mind them&mdash;here&rsquo;s the negro. We can&rsquo;t
      kick him out. That plan is childish. So, it&rsquo;s like two men having to live
      in one house. The white man would keep the house in repair, the black
      would let it rot. Well, the black must take orders from the white. And it
      will end so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was eager. &ldquo;Slavery again, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never! It was too injurious to ourselves. But something between
      slavery and equality.&rdquo; And I ended with a quotation: &ldquo;&lsquo;Patience, cousin,
      and shuffle the cards.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may call me cousin&mdash;this once&mdash;because you have been,
      really, quite nice&mdash;for a Northerner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now we had come to the place where she must understand me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a Northerner, Miss La Heu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She became mocking. &ldquo;Scarcely a Southerner, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I kept my smile and my directness. &ldquo;No more a Southerner than a
      Northerner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray what, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;sacred trust&rsquo;&mdash;for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my state seceded from the Union tomorrow, I should side with the Union
      against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was frankly astonished now. &ldquo;Would you really?&rdquo; And I think some light
      about me began to reach her. A Northerner willing to side against a
      Northern state! I was very glad that I had found that phrase to make clear
      to her my American creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I proceeded. &ldquo;I shall help to hand down all the glories and all the
      sadnesses; Lee&rsquo;s, Lincoln&rsquo;s, everybody&rsquo;s. But I shall not hand &lsquo;it&rsquo; down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This checked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for me, you know,&rdquo; I hastily explained. &ldquo;Nothing noble about it
      at all. But from noble people&rdquo;&mdash;and I looked hard at her&mdash;&ldquo;one
      expects, sooner or later, noble things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repressed something she had been going to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I have children,&rdquo; I finished, &ldquo;they shall know &lsquo;Dixie&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Yankee Doodle&rsquo; by heart, and never know the difference. By that time I
      should think they might have a chance of hearing &lsquo;Yankee Doodle&rsquo; in Kings
      Port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she checked a rapid retort. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she, after a pause, repeated,
      &ldquo;you have been really quite nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I tell you what you have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Have you seen Mr. Mayrant to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have an engagement to walk this afternoon. May I go walking with you
      sometime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May he, General?&rdquo; A wagging tail knocked on the floor behind the counter.
      &ldquo;General says that he will think about it. What makes you like Mr. Mayrant
      so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question struck me as an odd one; nor could I make out the import of
      the peculiar tone in which she put it. &ldquo;Why, I should think everybody
      would like him&mdash;except, perhaps, his double victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, first of his fist and then of&mdash;of his hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she didn&rsquo;t respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of his hand&mdash;his poker hand,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poker hand?&rdquo; She remained honestly vague.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rejoiced me to be the first to tell her. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard of Master
      John&rsquo;s last performance? Well, finding himself forced by that immeasurable
      old Aunt Josephine of yours to shake hands, he shook &lsquo;em all right, but he
      took thirty dollars away as a little set-off for his pious docility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she murmured, overwhelmed with astonishment. Then she broke into one
      of her delicious peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;likes a boy who plays a hand&mdash;and a fist&mdash;to
      that tune.&rdquo; I continued to say a number of commendatory words about young
      John, while her sparkling eyes rested upon me. But even as I talked I grew
      aware that these eyes were not sparkling, were starry rather, and distant,
      and that she was not hearing what I said; so I stopped abruptly, and at
      the stopping she spoke, like a person waking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Certainly he can take care of himself. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather creditable, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Creditable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering his aunts and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She became haughty on the instant. &ldquo;Upon my word! And do you suppose the
      women of South Carolina don&rsquo;t wish their men to be men? Why&rdquo;&mdash;she
      returned to mirth and that arch mockery which was her special charm&mdash;&ldquo;we
      South Carolina women consider virtue our business, and we don&rsquo;t expect the
      men to meddle with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Primal, perpetual, necessary!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;When that division gets blurred,
      society is doomed. Are you sure John can take care of himself every way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have other things than Mr. Mayrant to think about.&rdquo; She said this quite
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It surprised me. &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you once tell me
      that you thought he was simple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her ledger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great honor to have one&rsquo;s words so well
      remembered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was still at a loss. &ldquo;Anyhow, the wedding is postponed,&rdquo; I continued;
      &ldquo;and the cake. Of course one can&rsquo;t help wondering how it&rsquo;s all coming
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was now working at her ledger, bending her head over it. &ldquo;Have you
      ever met Miss Rieppe?&rdquo; She inquired this with a sort of wonderful softness&mdash;which
      I was to hear again upon a still more memorable occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nobody at present living whom I long to
      see so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote on for a little while before saying, with her pencil steadily
      busy, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Don&rsquo;t you? After all this fuss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;She is so much admired&mdash;by
      Northerners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope John is able to take care of himself,&rdquo; I purposely repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of yourself!&rdquo; she laughed angrily over her ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Why? I understand you less and less!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I want to help him!&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to marry her.
      Oh, by the way do you happen to know what it is that she is coming here to
      see for herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment her ledger was left, and she was looking at me straight.
      Coming? When?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon. In an automobile. To see something for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pondered for quite a long moment; then her eyes returned, searchingly,
      to me. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t make that up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and explained. &ldquo;Some of them, at any rate,&rdquo; I finished, &ldquo;know
      what she&rsquo;s coming for. They were rather queer about it, I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pondered again. I noticed that she had deeply flushed, and that the
      flush was leaving her. Then she fixed her eyes on me once more. &ldquo;They
      wouldn&rsquo;t tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that they came inadvertently near it, once or twice, and
      remembered just in time that I didn&rsquo;t know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since you do know pretty much about it!&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else, something that&rsquo;s turned up; the
      sort of thing that upsets calculations. And I merely hoped that you&rsquo;d
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On those last words of mine she gave me quite an extraordinary look, and
      then, as if satisfied with what she saw in my face.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an assurance, it was true, it had the ring of truth, that evident
      genuineness which a piece of real confidence always possesses; she meant
      me to know that we were in the same boat of ignorance to-day. And yet, as
      I rose from my lunch and came forward to settle for it, I was aware of
      some sense of defeat, of having been held off just as the ladies on High
      Walk had held me off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I sighed, &ldquo;I pin my faith to the aunt who says he&rsquo;ll never marry
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss La Heu had no more to say upon the subject. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you forgotten
      something?&rdquo; she inquired gayly; and, as I turned to see what I had left
      behind&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, you had no Lady Baltimore to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clean forgot it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No loss. It is very stale; and to-morrow I shall have a fresh supply
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I departed through the door I was conscious of her eyes following me,
      and that she had spoken of Lady Baltimore precisely because she was
      thinking of something else.

    <h2>
      XIV: The Replacers
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had been strange, perceptibly strange, had Eliza La Heu; that was the
      most which I could make out of it. I had angered her in some manner wholly
      beyond my intention or understanding and not all at one fixed point in our
      talk; her irritation had come out and gone in again in spots all along the
      colloquy, and it had been a displeasure wholly apart from that indignation
      which had flashed up in her over the negro question. This, indeed, I
      understood well enough, and admired her for, and admired still more her
      gallant control of it; as for the other, I gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of guilt&mdash;a very slight one, to be sure&mdash;dispersed my
      speculations when I was preparing for dinner, and Aunt Carola&rsquo;s
      postscript, open upon my writing-table, reminded me that I had never asked
      Miss La Heu about the Bombos. Well, the Bombos could keep! And I descended
      to dinner a little late (as too often) to feel instantly in the air that
      they had been talking about me. I doubt if any company in the world, from
      the Greeks down through Machiavelli to the present moment, has ever been
      of a subtlety adequate to conceal from an observant person entering a room
      the fact that he has been the subject of their conversation. This company,
      at any rate, did not conceal it from me. Not even when the upcountry bride
      astutely greeted me with:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we were just speaking of you! We were lust saying it would be a
      perfect shame if you missed those flowers at Live Oaks.&rdquo; And, at this,
      various of the guests assured me that another storm would finish them;
      upon which I assured every one that to-morrow should see me embark upon
      the Live Oaks excursion boat, knowing quite well in my heart that some
      decidedly different question concerning me had been hastily dropped upon
      my appearance at the door. It poked up its little concealed head, did this
      question, when the bride said later to me, with immense archness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How any gentleman can help falling just daid in love with that lovely
      young girl at the Exchange, I don&rsquo;t see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t helped it!&rdquo; I immediately exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; declared the bride with unerring perception, &ldquo;that just shows he
      hasn&rsquo;t been smitten at all! Well, I&rsquo;d be ashamed, if I was a single
      gentleman.&rdquo; And while I brought forth additional phrases concerning the
      distracted state of my heart, she looked at me with large, limpid eyes.
      &ldquo;Anybody could tell you&rsquo;re not afraid of a rival,&rdquo; was her resulting
      comment; upon which several of the et ceteras laughed more than seemed to
      me appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left them all free again to say what they pleased; for John Mayrant
      called for me to go upon our walk while we were still seated at table, and
      at table they remained after I had excused myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bruise over John&rsquo;s left eye was fading out, but traces of his
      spiritual battle were deepening. During the visit which he had paid (under
      compulsion, I am sure) to Juno at our boarding-house in company with Miss
      Josephine St. Michael, his recent financial triumph at the bedside had
      filled his face with diabolic elation as he confronted his victim&rsquo;s
      enraged but checkmated aunt; when to the thinly veiled venom of her
      inquiry as to a bridegroom&rsquo;s health he had retorted with venom as thinly
      veiled that he was feeling better that night than for many weeks, he had
      looked better, too; the ladies had exclaimed after his departure what a
      handsome young man he was, and Juno had remarked how fervently she trusted
      that marriage might cure him of his deplorable tendencies. But to-day his
      vitality had sagged off beneath the weight of his preoccupation: it looked
      to me as if, by a day or two more, the boy&rsquo;s face might be grown haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether by intention, or, as is more likely, by the perfectly natural and
      spontaneous working of his nature, he speedily made it plain to me that
      our relation, our acquaintance, had progressed to a stage more friendly
      and confidential. He did not reveal this by imparting any confidence to
      me; far from it; it was his silence that indicated the ease he had come to
      feel in my company. Upon our last memorable interview he had embarked at
      once upon a hasty yet evidently predetermined course of talk, because he
      feared that I might touch upon subjects which he wished excluded from all
      discussion between us; to-day he embarked upon nothing, made no
      conventional effort of any sort, but walked beside me, content with my
      mere society; if it should happen that either of us found a thought worth
      expressing aloud, good! and if this should not happen, why, good also! And
      so we walked mutely and agreeably together for a long while. The thought
      which was growing clear in my mind, and which was decidedly worthy of
      expression, was also unluckily one which his new reliance upon my
      discretion completely forbade my uttering in even the most shadowy manner;
      but it was a conviction which Miss Josephine St. Michael should have been
      quick to force upon him for his good. Quite apart from selfish reasons, he
      had no right to marry a girl whom he had ceased to care for. The code
      which held a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; to his plighted troth in such a case did more
      injury to the &ldquo;lady&rdquo; than any &ldquo;jilting&rdquo; could possibly do. Never until now
      had I thought this out so lucidly, and I was determined that time and my
      own tact should assuredly help me find a way to say it to him, if he
      continued in his present course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Ben says you can&rsquo;t be a real Northerner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was his first observation, and I think that we must have walked a
      mile before he made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I pounded a negro? Of course, he retains your Southern
      ante-bellum mythical notion of Northerners&mdash;all of us willing to have
      them marry our sisters. Well, there&rsquo;s a lady at our boarding-house who
      says you are a real gambler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impish look came curling round his lips, but for a moment only, and it
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shook Daddy Ben up a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having his grandson do it, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s used to his grandson! Grandsons in that race might just as well
      be dogs for all they know or care about their progenitors. Yet Daddy Ben
      spent his savings on educating Charles Cotesworth and two more&mdash;but
      not one of them will give the old man a house to-day. If ever I have a
      home&mdash;&rdquo; John stopped himself, and our silence was no longer easy; our
      unspoken thoughts looked out of our eyes so that they could not meet. Yet
      no one, unless directly invited by him, had the right to say to hint what
      I was thinking, except some near relative. Therefore, to relieve this
      silence which had ceased to be agreeable, I talked about Daddy Ben and his
      grandsons, and negro voting, and the huge lie of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; which our lips
      vociferate and our lives daily disprove. This took us comfortably away
      from weddings and cakes into the subject of lynching, my violent
      condemnation of which surprised him; for our discussion had led us over a
      wide field, and one fertile in well-known disputes of the evergreen sort,
      conducted by the North mostly with more theory than experience, and by the
      South mostly with more heat than light; whereas, between John and me, I
      may say that our amiability was surpassed only by our intelligence! Each
      allowed for the other&rsquo;s standpoint, and both met in many views: he would
      have voted against the last national Democratic ticket but for the
      Republican upholding of negro equality, while I assured him that such
      stupid and criminal upholding was on the wane. He informed me that he did
      not believe the pure blooded African would ever be capable of taking the
      intellectual side of the white man&rsquo;s civilization, and I informed him that
      we must patiently face this probability, and teach the African whatever he
      could profitably learn and no more; and each of us agreed with the other.
      I think that we were at one, save for the fact that I was, after all, a
      Northerner&mdash;and that is a blemish which nobody in Kings Port can
      quite get over. John, therefore, was unprepared for my wholesale
      denunciation of lynching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your clear view of the negro,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man, it&rsquo;s my clear view of the white! It&rsquo;s the white, the
      American citizen, the &lsquo;hope of humanity,&rsquo; as he enjoys being called, who,
      after our English-speaking race has abolished public executions,
      degenerates back to the Stone Age. It&rsquo;s upon him that lynching works the
      true injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re nothing but animals,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you treat an animal in that way?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He persisted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do it yourself if you had to suffer from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably. Is that an answer? What I&rsquo;d never do would be to make a
      show, an entertainment, a circus, out of it, run excursion trains to see
      it&mdash;come, should you like your sister to buy tickets for a lynching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought him up rather short. &ldquo;I should never take part myself,&rdquo; he
      presently stated, &ldquo;unless it were immediate personal vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few brothers or husbands would blame you,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;It would be hard
      to wait for the law. But let no community which treats it as a public
      spectacle presume to call itself civilized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a perplexed smile, shaking his head over it. &ldquo;Sometimes I think
      civilization costs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Civilization costs all you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than I&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mortal tired of civilization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! What male creature is not? And neither of us will live quite
      long enough to see the smash-up of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sometimes inconsistent?&rdquo; he inquired, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Consistency is a form of death. The dead are the
      only perfectly consistent people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sometimes you sound like a Socialist,&rdquo; he pursued, still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t class me with those untrained puppies of
      thought. And you&rsquo;ll generally observe,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;that the more nobly a
      Socialist vaporizes about the rights of humanity, the more wives and
      children he has abandoned penniless along the trail of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was livelier than ever at this. &ldquo;What date have you fixed for the
      smash-up of our present civilization?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why fix dates? Is it not diversion enough to watch, and step handsomely
      through one&rsquo;s own part, with always a good sleeve to laugh in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pensiveness returned upon him. &ldquo;I shall be able to step through my own
      part, I think.&rdquo; He paused, and I was wondering secretly, &ldquo;Does that
      include the wedding?&rdquo; when he continued: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to laugh at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, our imperishable selves! For instance: we swear by universal
      suffrage. Well, sows&rsquo; ears are an invaluable thing in their place, on the
      head of the animal; but send them to make your laws, and what happens?
      Bribery, naturally. The silk purse buys the sow&rsquo;s ear. We swear by
      Christianity, but dishonesty is our present religion. That little phrase
      &lsquo;In God We Trust&rsquo; is about as true as the silver dollar it&rsquo;s stamped on&mdash;worth
      some thirty-nine cents. We get awfully serious about whether or no good
      can come of evil, when every sky-scraping thief of finance is helping
      hospitals with one hand while the other&rsquo;s in my pocket; and good and evil
      attend each other, lead to each other, are such Siamese twins that if
      separated they would both die. We make phrases about peace, pity, and
      brotherhood, while every nation stands prepared for shipwreck and for the
      sinking plank to which two are clinging and the stronger pushes the weaker
      into the flood and thus floats safe. Why, the old apple of wisdom, which
      Adam and Eve swallowed and thus lost their innocence, was a gentle nursery
      drug compared with the new apple of competition, which, as soon as chewed,
      instantly transforms the heart into a second brain. But why worry, when
      nothing is final? Haven&rsquo;t you and I, for instance, lamented the present
      rottenness of smart society? Why, when kings by the name of George sat on
      the throne of England, society was just as drunken, just as dissolute!
      Then a decent queen came, and society behaved itself; and now, here we
      come round again to the Georges, only with the name changed! There&rsquo;s
      nothing final. So, when things are as you don&rsquo;t like them, remember that
      and bear them; and when they&rsquo;re as you do like them, remember it and make
      the most of them&mdash;and keep a good sleeve handy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got any creed at all?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; but I don&rsquo;t live up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not expected. May I ask what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can probably bear it. Aunt Eliza had a classical tutor for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I always relish a chance to recite my favorite poet, and I began
      accordingly:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Laetus in praesens animus quod ultra est
          Oderit curare et&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that one!&rdquo; he exclaimed, interrupting me. &ldquo;The tutor made me put
      it into English verse. I had the severest sort of a time. I ran away from
      it twice to a deer-hunt.&rdquo; And he, in his turn, recited:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Who hails each present hour with zest
          Hates fretting what may be the rest,
          Makes bitter sweet with lazy jest;
          Naught is in every portion blest.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I complimented him, in spite of my slight annoyance at being deprived by
      him of the chance to declaim Latin poetry, which is an exercise that I
      approve and enjoy; but of course, to go on with it, after he had
      intervened with his translation, would have been flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have written good English, and very close to the Latin, too,&rdquo; I told
      him, &ldquo;particularly in the last line.&rdquo; And I picked up from the bridge
      which we were crossing, an oyster-shell, and sent it skimming over the
      smooth water that stretched between the low shores, wide, blue, and
      vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wonder why we call this the &lsquo;New Bridge,&rsquo;&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did wonder when I first came,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting used to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This long structure wore, in truth, no appearance of yesterday. It was
      newer than the &ldquo;New Bridge&rdquo; which it had replaced some fifteen years ago,
      and which for forty years had borne the same title. Spanning the broad
      river upon a legion of piles, this wooden causeway lies low against the
      face of the water, joining the town with a serene and pensive country of
      pines and live oaks and level opens, where glimpses of cabin and
      plantation serve to increase the silence and the soft, mysterious
      loneliness. Into this the road from the bridge goes straight and among the
      purple vagueness gently dissolves away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We watched a slow, deep-laden boat sliding down toward the draw, across
      which we made our way, and drew near the further end of the bridge. The
      straight avenue of the road in front of us took my eyes down its quiet
      vista, until they were fixed suddenly by an alien object, a growing dot,
      accompanied by dust, whence came the small, distorted honks of an
      automobile. These fat, importunate sounds redoubled as the machine rushed
      toward the bridge, growing up to its full staring, brazen dimensions. Six
      or seven figures sat in it, all of the same dusty, shrouded likeness,
      their big glass eyes and their masked mouths suggesting some fabled,
      unearthly race, a family of replete and bilious ogres; so that as they
      flew honking by us I called out to John:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the yellow rich!&rdquo; and then remembered that his Hortense probably
      sat among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honks redoubled, and we turned to see that the drawbridge had no
      thought of waiting for them. We also saw a bewildered curly white dog and
      a young girl, who called despairingly to him as he disappeared beneath the
      automobile. The engine of murder could not, as is usual, proceed upon its
      way, honking, for the drawbridge was visibly swinging open to admit the
      passage of the boat. When John and I had run back near enough to become
      ourselves a part of the incident, the white dog lay still behind the
      stationary automobile, whose passengers were craning their muffled necks
      and glass eyes to see what they had done, while one of their number had
      got out, and was stooping to examine if the machine had sustained any
      injuries. The young girl, with a face of anguish, was calling the dog&rsquo;s
      name as she hastened toward him, and her voice aroused him: he lifted his
      head, got on his legs, and walked over to her, which action on his part
      brought from the automobile a penetrating female voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s in better luck than that Savannah dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But General was not in luck. He lay quietly down at the feet of his
      mistress and we soon knew that life had passed from his faithful body. The
      first stroke of grief, dealt her in such cruel and sudden form, overbore
      the poor girl&rsquo;s pride and reserve; she made no attempt to remember or heed
      surroundings, but kneeling and placing her arms about the neck of her dead
      servant, she spoke piteously aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I raised him, I raised him from a puppy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The female voice, at this, addressed the traveller who was examining the
      automobile: &ldquo;Charley, a five or a ten spot is what her feelings need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obedient and munificent Charley straightened up from his stooping
      among the mechanical entrails, dexterously produced money, and advanced
      with the selected bill held out politely in his hand, while the glass eyes
      and the masks peered down at the performance. Eliza La Heu had perceived
      none of this, for she was intent upon General; nor had John Mayrant, who
      had approached her with the purpose of coming to her aid. But when
      Charley, quite at hand, began to speak words which were instantly
      obliterated from my memory by what happened, the young girl realized his
      intention and straightened stiffly, while John, with the rapidity of
      light, snatched the extended bill from Charley&rsquo;s hand, and tearing it in
      four pieces, threw it in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A foreign voice cackled from the automobile: &ldquo;Oh la la! il a du panache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Charley now disclosed himself to be a true man of the world&mdash;the
      financial world&mdash;by picking the pieces out of the mud; and, while he
      wiped them and enclosed them in his handkerchief and with perfect dignity
      returned them to his pocket, he remarked simply, with a shrug: &ldquo;As you
      please.&rdquo; His accent also was ever so little foreign&mdash;that New York
      downtown foreign, of the second generation, which stamps so, many of our
      bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female now leaned from her seat, and with the tone of setting the
      whole thing right, explained: &ldquo;We had no idea it was a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless you&rsquo;re not accustomed to their appearance,&rdquo; said John to
      Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know what Charley would have done about this; for while the
      completely foreign voice was delightedly whispering, &ldquo;Toujours le
      panache!&rdquo; a new, deep, and altogether different female voice exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, John, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was Hortense, then! That rich and quiet utterance was hers, a
      schooled and studied management of speech. I found myself surprised, and I
      knew directly why; that word of one of the old ladles, &ldquo;I consider that
      she looks like a steel wasp,&rdquo; had implanted in me some definite
      anticipations to which the voice certainly did not correspond. How
      fervently I desired that she would lift her thick veil, while John, with
      hat in hand, was greeting her, and being presented to her companions! Why
      she had not spoken to John sooner was of course a recondite question, and
      beyond my power to determine with merely the given situation to guide me.
      Hadn&rsquo;t she recognized him before? Had her thick veil, and his position,
      and the general slight flurry of the misadventure, intercepted recognition
      until she heard his voice when he addressed Charley. Or had she known her
      lover at once, and rapidly decided that the moment was an unpropitious one
      for a first meeting after absence, and that she would pass on to Kings
      Port unrevealed, but then had found this plan become impossible through
      the collision between Charley and John? It was not until certain incidents
      of the days following brought Miss Rieppe&rsquo;s nature a good deal further
      home to me, that a third interpretation of her delay in speaking to John
      dawned upon my mind; that I was also made aware how a woman&rsquo;s
      understanding of the words &ldquo;Steel wasp,&rdquo; when applied by her to one of her
      own sex, may differ widely from a man&rsquo;s understanding of them; and that
      Miss Rieppe, through her thick veil, saw from her seat in the automobile
      something which my own unencumbered vision had by no means detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, here on the bridge, even her outward appearance was as shrouded
      as her inward qualities&mdash;save such as might be audible in that voice,
      as her skilful, well-placed speeches to one and the other of the company
      tided over and carried off into ease this uneasy moment. All men, at such
      a voice, have pricked up their ears since the beginning; there was much
      woman in it; each slow, schooled syllable called its challenge to questing
      man. But I got no chance to look in the eye that went with that voice; she
      took all the advantages which her veil gave her; and how well she used
      them I was to learn later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the general smoothing-out process which she was so capably effecting,
      her attention was about to reach me, when my name was suddenly called out
      from behind her. It was Beverly Rodgers, that accomplished and inveterate
      bachelor of fashion. Ten years before, when I had seen much of him, he had
      been more particular in his company, frequently declaring in his genial,
      irresponsible way that New York society was going to the devil. But many
      tempting dances on the land, and cruises on the water, had taken him deep
      among our lower classes that have boiled up from the bottom with their
      millions&mdash;and besides, there would be nothing to marvel at in
      Beverly&rsquo;s presence in any company that should include Hortense Rieppe, if
      she carried out the promise of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly was his customary, charming, effusive self, coming out of the
      automobile to me with his &ldquo;By Jove, old man,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought
      it, old fellow?&rdquo; and sprinkling urbane little drops of jocosity over us
      collectively, as the garden water-turning apparatus sprinkles a lawn. His
      knowing me, and the way he brought it out, and even the tumbling into the
      road of a few wraps and chattels of travel as he descended from the
      automobile, and the necessity of picking these up and handing them back
      with delightful little jocular apologies, such as, &ldquo;By Jove, what a lout I
      am,&rdquo; all this helped the meeting on prodigiously, and got us gratefully
      away from the disconcerting incident of the torn money. Charley was
      helpful, too; you would never have supposed from the polite small-talk
      which he was now offering to John Mayrant that he had within some three
      minutes received the equivalent of a slap across the eyes from that youth,
      and carried the soiled consequences in his pocket. And such a thing is it
      to be a true man of the world of finance, that upon the arrival now of a
      second automobile, also his property, and containing a set of maids and
      valets, and also some live dogs sitting up, covered with glass eyes and
      wrappings like their owners, munificent Charley at once offered the dead
      dog and his mistress a place in it, and begged she would let it take her
      wherever she wished to go. Everybody exclaimed copiously and condolingly
      over the unfortunate occurrence. What a fine animal he was, to be sure!
      What breed was he? Of course, he wasn&rsquo;t used to automobiles! Was it quite
      certain that he was dead? Quel dommage! And Charley would be so happy to
      replace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how was Eliza La Heu bearing herself amid these murmurously chattered
      infelicities? She was listening with composure to the murmurs of Hortense
      Rieppe, more felicitous, no doubt. Miss Rieppe, through her veil, was
      particularly devoting herself to Miss La Lieu. I could not hear what she
      said; the little chorus of condolence and suggestion intercepted all save
      her tone, and that, indeed, coherently sustained its measured cadence
      through the texture of fragments uttered by Charley and the others. Eliza
      La Heu had now got herself altogether in hand, and, saving her pale
      cheeks, no sign betrayed that the young girl&rsquo;s feelings had been so
      recently too strong for her. To these strangers, ignorant of her usual
      manner, her present strange quietness may very well have been accepted as
      her habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she replied to munificent Charley&rsquo;s offer that she would use
      his second automobile. She managed to make her polite words cut like a
      scythe. &ldquo;I should crowd it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they shall get out and walk; it will be good for them,&rdquo; said Charley,
      indicating the valets and maids, and possibly the dogs, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly Rodgers did much better than Charley. With a charming gesture and
      bow, he offered his own seat in the first automobile. &ldquo;I am going to walk
      in any case,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One gentleman among them,&rdquo; I heard John Mayrant mutter behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss La Heu declined, the chorus urged, but Beverly (who was indeed a
      gentleman, every inch of him) shook his head imperceptibly at Charley; and
      while the little exclamations&mdash;&ldquo;Do come! So much more comfortable! So
      nice to see more of you!&rdquo;&mdash;dropped away, Miss La Heu had settled her
      problem quite simply for herself. A little procession of vehicles,
      townward bound, had gathered on the bridge, waiting until the closing of
      the draw should allow them to continue upon their way. From these most of
      the occupants had descended, and were staring with avidity at us all; the
      great glass eyes and the great refulgent cars held them in timidity and
      fascination, and the poor lifeless white body of General, stretched beside
      the way, heightened the hypnotic mystery; one or two of the boldest had
      touched him, and found no outward injury upon him; and this had sent their
      eyes back to the automobile with increased awe. Eliza La Heu summoned one
      of the onlookers, an old negro; at some word she said to him he hurried
      back and returned, leading his horse and empty cart, and General was
      lifted into this. The girl took her seat beside the old driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said to John Mayrant, &ldquo;certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered at the needless severity with which she declined his offer to
      accompany her and help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the wheel of the cart, looking up at her and protesting, and I
      joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;I need no one. You will both oblige me by
      saying no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John!&rdquo; It was the slow, well-calculated utterance of Hortense Rieppe. Did
      I hear in it the caressing note of love?
    </p>
    <p>
      John turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The draw had swung to, the mast and sail of the vessel were separating
      away from the bridge with a stealthy motion, men with iron bars were at
      work fastening the draw secure, and horses&rsquo; hoofs knocked nervously upon
      the wooden flooring as the internal churning of the automobiles burst upon
      their innocent ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, if Mr. Rodgers is really not going with us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Hortense; and at that Miss La Heu:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you keep them waiting?&rdquo; There was no caress in that note! It was
      polished granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her on her high seat by the extremely dilapidated negro,
      and then he walked forward and took his place beside his veiled fiancee,
      among the glass eyes. A hiss of sharp noise spurted from the automobiles,
      horses danced, and then, smoothly, the two huge engines were gone with
      their cargo of large, distorted shapes, leaving behind them&mdash;quite as
      our present epoch will leave behind it&mdash;a trail of power, of
      ingenuity, of ruthlessness, and a bad smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard, old boy!&rdquo; chuckled Beverly, to whom I communicated this
      sentiment. &ldquo;How do you know the stink of one generation does not become
      the perfume of the next?&rdquo; Beverly, when he troubled to put a thing at all
      (which was seldom&mdash;for he kept his quite good brains well-nigh
      perpetually turned out to grass&mdash;or rather to grass widows) always
      put it well, and with a bracing vocabulary. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he now exclaimed, and
      walked out into the middle of the roadway, where he picked up a parasol.
      &ldquo;Kitty will be in a jolly old stew. None of its expensive bones broken
      however.&rdquo; And then he hailed me by a name of our youth. &ldquo;What are you
      doing down here, you old sourbelly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watching you sun yourself on the fat cushions of the yellow rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shucks, old man, they&rsquo;re not so yellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley strikes me as yellower than his own gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley&rsquo;s not a bad little sort. Of course, he needs coaching a bit here
      and there&mdash;just now, for instance, when he didn&rsquo;t see that that girl
      wouldn&rsquo;t think of riding in the machine that had just killed her dog. By
      Jove, give that girl a year in civilization and she&rsquo;d do! Who was the
      young fire-eater?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire-eater! He&rsquo;s a lot more decent than you or I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s saying so little, dear boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously, Beverly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it with your &lsquo;seriously&rsquo;! Well, then, seriously, melodrama was
      the correct ticket and all that in 1840, but we&rsquo;ve outgrown it; it&rsquo;s
      devilish demode to chuck things in people&rsquo;s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry John Mayrant did it!&rdquo; I brought out his name with due
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Beverly was beginning, when the automobile returned
      rapidly upon us, and, guessing the cause of this, he waved the parasol.
      Charley descended to get it&mdash;an unnecessary act, prompted, I suppose,
      by the sudden relief of finding that it was not lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his thanks marked. &ldquo;It is my sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he concluded, to me, by
      way of explanation, in his slightly foreign accent. &ldquo;It is not much, but
      it has got some stones and things in the handle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were favored with a bow from the veiled Hortense, shrill thanks from
      Kitty, and the car, turning, again left us in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a Frenchman along,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Gazza,&rdquo; Beverly returned. &ldquo;Italian; though from his morals you&rsquo;d
      never guess he wasn&rsquo;t Parisian. Great people in Rome. Hereditary right to
      do something in the presence of the Pope&mdash;or not to do it, I forget
      which. Not a bit of a bad little sort, Gazza. He has just sold a lot of
      old furniture&mdash;Renaissance&mdash;Lorenzo du Borgia&mdash;that sort of
      jolly old truck&mdash;to Bohm, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do, old boy. Harry Bohm, of Bohm &amp; Cohn. Everybody knows
      Bohm, and we&rsquo;ll all be knowing Cohn by next year. Gazza has sold him a lot
      of furniture, too. Bohm&rsquo;s from Pittsfield, or South Lee, or East Canaan,
      or West Stockbridge, or some of those other back-country cider presses
      that squirt some of the hardest propositions into Wall Street. He&rsquo;s just
      back from buying a railroad, and four or five mines in Mexico. Bohm
      represents Christianity in the firm. At Newport they call him the military
      attache to Jerusalem. He&rsquo;s the big chap that sat behind me in the car.
      He&rsquo;ll marry Kitty as soon as she can get her divorce. Bohm&rsquo;s a jolly old
      sort&mdash;and I tell you, you old sourbelly, you&rsquo;re letting this Southern
      moss grow over you a bit. Hey? What? Yellow rich isn&rsquo;t half bad, and I&rsquo;ll
      say it myself, and pretend it&rsquo;s mine; but hang it, old man, their children
      won&rsquo;t be worse than lemon-colored, and the grandchildren will be white!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;to take a back seat with their evaporated
      fortunes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beverly chuckled. &ldquo;Well, if they do evaporate, there will be new ones. Now
      don&rsquo;t walk along making Mayflower eyes at me. I&rsquo;m no Puritan, and my
      people have had a front seat since pretty early in the game, which I&rsquo;m
      holding on to, you know. And by Jove, old man, I tell you, if you wish to
      hold on nowadays, you can&rsquo;t be drawing lines! If you don&rsquo;t want to see
      yourself jolly well replaced, you must fall in with the replacers. Our
      blooming old republic is merely the quickest process of endless replacing
      yet discovered, and you take my tip, and back the replacers! That&rsquo;s where
      Miss Rieppe, for all her Kings Port traditions, shows sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned square on him. &ldquo;Then she has broken it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her engagement to John Mayrant. You mean to say that you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, old man. Seriously. The fire-eater?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was so very much bewildered that I merely stared at Beverly Rodgers. Of
      course, I might have known that Miss Rieppe would not feel the need of
      announcing to her rich Northern friends an engagement which she had fallen
      into the habit of postponing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beverly had a better right to be taken aback. &ldquo;I suppose you must have
      some reason for your remark,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re engaged to her?&rdquo; I shot out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? With my poor little fifteen thousand a year? Consider, dear boy! Oh,
      no, we&rsquo;re merely playing at it, she and I. She&rsquo;s a good player. But
      Charley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is?&rdquo; I shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, old man, and I don&rsquo;t think he knows&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let me tell you.&rdquo; And I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had got himself adjusted to the novelty of it he began to take it
      with a series of thoughtful chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into these I dropped with: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s her father, anyhow?&rdquo; I began to feel,
      fantastically, that she mightn&rsquo;t have a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stopped in Savannah,&rdquo; Beverly answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming over by the
      train. Kitty&mdash;Charley&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Bleecker&mdash;did the
      chaperoning for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very expertly, I should guess,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; invisibly,&rdquo; said Beverly. And he returned to his thoughts and
      his chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s simple,&rdquo; he presently remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that depend on what she&rsquo;s here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to break it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why come for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took another turn among his cogitations. I took a number of turns among
      my own, but it was merely walking round and round in a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will she announce it, then?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;You said she was a good player.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a fire-eater!&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;For her. Oh, hang it! She&rsquo;ll let him go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. &ldquo;Well, of course her game could be spoiled by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His speech died away into more cogitation, and I had to ask him what he
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By love getting into it somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked on through Worship Street, which we had reached some while
      since, and the chief features of which I mechanically pointed out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly old church, that,&rdquo; said Beverly, as we reached my favorite corner
      and brick wall. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll not announce it!&rdquo; he murmured gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Kings Port will do all the announcing for you
      to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XV: What She Came to See
    </h2>
    <p>
      But in this matter my prognostication was thoroughly at fault; yet surely,
      knowing Kings Port&rsquo;s sovereign habit, as I had had good cause to know it,
      I was scarce beyond reasonable bounds in supposing that the arrival of
      Miss Rieppe would heat up some very general and very audible talk about
      this approaching marriage, against which the prejudices of the town were
      set in such compact array. I have several times mentioned that Kings Port,
      to my sense, was buzzing over John Mayrant&rsquo;s affairs; buzzing in the open,
      where one could hear it, and buzzing behind closed doors, where one could
      somehow feel it; I can only say that henceforth this buzzing ceased,
      dropped wholly away, as if Gossip were watching so hard that she forgot to
      talk, giving place to a great stillness in her kingdom. Such occasional
      words as were uttered sounded oddly and egregiously clear in the
      new-established void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these words sounded, indeed, quite enormous, issuing as it
      did from Juno&rsquo;s lips at our breakfast-table, when yesterday&rsquo;s meeting on
      the New Bridge was investing my mind with many thoughts. She addressed me
      in one of her favorite tones (I have met it, thank God! but in two or
      three other cases during my whole experience), which always somehow
      conveyed to you that you were personally to blame for what she was going
      to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know that your friend, Mr. Mayrant, has resigned from the
      Custom House?&rdquo;

    <p>
      I was, of course, careful not to give Juno the pleasure of seeing that she
      had surprised me. I bowed, and continued in silence to sip a little
      coffee; then, setting my coffee down, I observed that it would be some few
      days yet before the resignation could take effect; and, noticing that Juno
      was getting ready some new remark, I branched off and spoke to her of my
      excursion up the river this morning to see the azaleas in the gardens at
      Live Oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lucky the weather is so magnificent!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be interested to hear,&rdquo; said Juno, &ldquo;what explanation he finds to
      give Miss Josephine for his disrespectful holding out against her, and his
      immediate yielding to Miss Rieppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I deemed it safe to ask her, was she quite sure it had been at the
      instance of Miss Rieppe that John had resigned?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It follows suspiciously close upon her arrival,&rdquo; stated Juno. She might
      have been speaking of a murder. &ldquo;And how he expects to support a wife now&mdash;well,
      that is no affair of mine,&rdquo; Juno concluded, with a washing-her-hands-of-it
      air, as if up to this point she had always done her best for the wilful
      boy. She had blamed him savagely for not resigning, and now she was
      blaming him because he had resigned; and I ate my breakfast in much
      entertainment over this female acrobat in censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said; I think that my manner of taking Juno&rsquo;s news had been
      perfectly successful in disappointing her. John&rsquo;s resignation, if it had
      really occurred, did certainly follow very close upon the arrival of
      Hortense; but I had spoken one true thought in intimating that I doubted
      if it was due to the influence of Miss Rieppe. It seemed to me to the
      highest degree unlikely that the boy in his present state of feeling would
      do anything he did not wish to do because his ladylove happened to wish it&mdash;except
      marry her! There was apparently no doubt that he would do that. Did she
      want him, poverty and all? Was she, even now, with eyes open, deliberately
      taking her last farewell days of automobiles and of steam yachts? That
      voice of hers, that rich summons, with its quiet certainty of power,
      sounded in my memory. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she had called to him from the automobile;
      and thus John had gone away in it, wedged in among Charley and the fat
      cushions and all the money and glass eyes. And now he had resigned from
      the Custom House! Yes, that was, whatever it signified, truly amazing&mdash;if
      true.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I continued to ponder quite uselessly, until the up-country bride
      aroused me. She, it appeared, had been greatly carried away by the beauty
      of Live Oaks, and was making her David take her there again this morning;
      and she was asking me didn&rsquo;t I hope we shouldn&rsquo;t get stuck? The people had
      got stuck yesterday, three whole hours, right on a bank in the river; and
      wasn&rsquo;t it a sin and a shame to run a boat with ever so many passengers
      aground? By the doctrine of chances, I informed her, we had every right to
      hope for better luck to-day; and, with the assurance of how much my
      felicity was increased by the prospect of having her and David as company
      during the expedition, I betook myself meanwhile to my own affairs, which
      meant chiefly a call at the Exchange to inquire for Eliza La Heu, and a
      visit to the post-office before starting upon a several hours&rsquo; absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps from our front door I came upon John Mayrant, and saw at once
      too plainly that no ease had come to his spirit during the hours since the
      bridge. He was just emerging from an adjacent house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you resigned?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s done. You haven&rsquo;t seen Miss Rieppe this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s surely not boarding with Mrs. Trevise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; stopping here with her old friend, Mrs. Cornerly.&rdquo; He indicated the
      door he had come from. &ldquo;Of course, you wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to see her
      pass!&rdquo; And with that he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he was greatly stirred up by something there could be no doubt; never
      before had I seen him so abrupt; it seemed clear that anger had taken the
      place of despondency, or whatever had been his previous mood; and by the
      time I reached the post-office I had already imagined and dismissed the
      absurd theory that John was jealous of Charley, had resigned from the
      Custom House as a first step toward breaking his engagement, and had rung
      Mrs. Cornerly&rsquo;s bell at this early hour with the purpose of informing his
      lady-love that all was over between them. Jealousy would not be likely to
      produce this set of manifestations in young, foolish John; and I may say
      here at once, what I somewhat later learned, that the boy had come with
      precisely the opposite purpose, namely, to repeat and reenforce his
      steadfast constancy, and that it was something far removed from jealousy
      which had spurred him to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the girl behind the counter at her post, grateful to me for coming
      to ask how she was after the shock of yesterday, but unwilling to speak of
      it at all; all which she expressed by her charming manner, and by the
      other subjects she chose for conversation, and especially by the way in
      which she held out her hand when I took my leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the post-office I was hailed by Beverly Rodgers, who proclaimed to me
      at once a comic but genuine distress. He had already walked, he said (and
      it was but half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, as he bitterly bade me observe on the
      church dial), more miles in search of a drink than his unarithmetical
      brain had the skill to compute. And he confounded such a town heartily; he
      should return as soon as possible to Charley&rsquo;s yacht, where there was
      civilization, and where he had spent the night. During his search he had
      at length come to a door of promising appearance, and gone in there, and
      they had explained to him that it was a dispensary. A beastly arrangement.
      What was the name of the razor-back hog they said had invented it? And
      what did you do for a drink in this confounded water-hole?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would find it no water-hole, I told him; but there were methods which a
      stranger upon his first morning could scarce be expected to grasp. &ldquo;I
      could direct you to a Dutchman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re too well dressed to
      win his confidence at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; began Beverly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak Dutch, but give me a crack
      at the confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, he renounced the project upon learning what a Dutchman was. Since
      my hours were no longer dedicated to establishing the presence of royal
      blood in my veins I had spent them upon various local investigations of a
      character far more entertaining and akin to my taste. It was in truth
      quite likely that Beverly could in a very few moments, with his smile and
      his manner, find his way to any Dutchman&rsquo;s heart; he had that divine gift
      of winning over to him quickly all sorts and conditions of men; and my
      account of the ingenious and law-baffling contrivances, which you found at
      these little grocery shops, at once roused his curiosity to make a trial;
      but he decided that the club was better, if less picturesque. And he told
      me that all the men of the automobile party had received from John Mayrant
      cards of invitation to the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your fire-eater is a civil chap,&rdquo; said Beverly. &ldquo;And by the way, do you
      happen to know,&rdquo; here he pulled from his pocket a letter and consulted its
      address, &ldquo;Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted that he brought an introduction to this lady; Hortense
      Rieppe could not open for him any of those haughty doors; and I wished not
      only that Beverly (since he was just the man to appreciate it and
      understand it) should see the fine flower of Kings Port, but also that the
      fine flower of Kings Port should see him; the best blood of the South
      could not possibly turn out anything better than Beverly Rodgers, and it
      was horrible and humiliating to think of the other Northern specimens of
      men whom Hortense had imported with her. I was here suddenly reminded that
      the young woman was a guest of the Cornerlys, the people who swept their
      garden, the people whom Eliza La Heu at the Exchange did not &ldquo;know&rdquo;; and
      at this the remark of Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, when I had walked with her
      and Mrs. Weguelin, took on an added lustre of significance:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Call on the Cornerlys! Would they do that? Were they ready to stand by
      their John to that tune? A hotel would be nothing; you could call on
      anybody at a hotel, if you had to; but here would be a demarche indeed!
      Yet, nevertheless, I felt quite certain that, if Hortense, though the
      Cornerlys&rsquo; guest, was also the guaranteed fiancee of John Mayrant, the old
      ladies would come up to the scratch, hate and loathe it as they might, and
      undoubtedly would: they could be trusted to do the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Beverly how glad I was that he would meet Mrs. Weguelin St.
      Michael. &ldquo;The rest of your party, my friend,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are not very likely
      to.&rdquo; And I generalized to him briefly upon the town of Kings Port.
      &ldquo;Supposing I take you to call upon Mrs. St. Michael when I come back this
      afternoon?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly thought it over, and then shook his head. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t do, old man.
      If these people are particular and know, as you say they do, hadn&rsquo;t I
      better leave the letter with my card, and then wait till she sends some
      word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was right, as he always was, unerringly. Consorting with all the
      Charleys, and the Bohms, and the Cohns, and the Kitties hadn&rsquo;t taken the
      fine edge from Beverly&rsquo;s good inheritance and good bringing up; his
      instinct had survived his scruples, making of him an agile and charming
      cynic, whom you could trust to see the right thing always, and never do it
      unless it was absolutely necessary; he would marry any amount of Kitties
      for their money, and always know that beside his mother and sisters they
      were as dirt; and he would see to it that his children took after their
      father, went to school in England for a good accent and enunciation, as he
      had done, went to college in America for the sake of belonging in their
      own country, as he had done, and married as many fortunes, and had as few
      divorces, as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that girl on the bridge?&rdquo; he now inquired as we reached the steps
      of the post-office; and when I had told him again, because he had asked me
      about Eliza La Heu at the time, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the real thing,&rdquo; he commented.
      &ldquo;Quite extraordinary, you know, her dignity, when poor old awful Charley
      was messing everything&mdash;he&rsquo;s so used to mere money, you know, that
      half the time he forgets people are not dollars, and you have to kick him
      to remind him&mdash;yes, quite perfect dignity. Gad, it took a lady to
      climb up and sit by that ragged old darky and take her dead dog away in
      the cart! The cart and the darky only made her look what she was all the
      more. Poor Kitty couldn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;she&rsquo;d look like a chambermaid!
      Well, old man, see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood on the post-office steps looking after Beverly Rodgers as he
      crossed Court Street. His admirably good clothes, the easy finish of his
      whole appearance, even his walk, and his back, and the slope of his
      shoulders, were unmistakable. The Southern men, going to their business in
      Court Street, looked at him. Alas, in his outward man he was as a rose
      among weeds! And certainly, no well-born American could unite with an art
      more hedonistic than Beverly&rsquo;s the old school and the nouveau jeu!
    </p>
    <p>
      Over at the other corner he turned and stood admiring the church and
      gazing at the other buildings, and so perceived me still on the steps.
      With a gesture of remembering something he crossed back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not seen Miss Rieppe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I exclaimed. Was everybody going to ask me
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something&rsquo;s up, old boy. Charley has got the launch away with him&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s got her away with him, too. Charley lied this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is lying, then, so rare with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it rather is, you know. But I&rsquo;ve come to be able to spot him when he
      does it. Those little bulgy eyes of his look at you particularly straight
      and childlike. He said he had to hunt up a man on business&mdash;V-C
      Chemical Company, he called it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a thing here,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Charley&rsquo;d never make up a thing, and get found out in that way! But
      he was lying all the same, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean they&rsquo;ve run off and got married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take them for? Much more like them to run off and not get
      married. But they haven&rsquo;t done that either. And, speaking of that, I
      believe I&rsquo;ve gone a bit adrift. Your fire-eater, you know&mdash;she is an
      extraordinary woman!&rdquo; And Beverly gave his mellow, little humorous
      chuckle. &ldquo;Hanged if I don&rsquo;t begin to think she does fancy him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that would explain&mdash;no, it wouldn&rsquo;t. Whence comes
      your theory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw her look at him at dinner once last night. We dined with some people&mdash;Cornerly.
      She looked at him just once. Well, if she intends&mdash;by gad, it upsets
      one&rsquo;s whole notion of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t just one look rather slight basis for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, old man, you know better than that!&rdquo; Beverly paused to chuckle. &ldquo;My
      grandmother Livingston,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;knew Aaron Burr, and she used to say
      that he had an eye which no honest woman could meet without a blush. I
      don&rsquo;t know whether your fire-eater is a Launcelot, or a Galahad, but that
      girl&rsquo;s eye at dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he blush?&rdquo; I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I saw. But really, old man, confound it, you know! He&rsquo;s no sort
      of husband for her. How can he make her happy and how can she make him
      happy, and how can either of them hit it off with the other the least
      little bit? She&rsquo;s expensive, he&rsquo;s not; she&rsquo;s up-to-date, he&rsquo;s not; she&rsquo;s
      of the great world, he&rsquo;s provincial. She&rsquo;s all derision, he&rsquo;s all faith.
      Why, hang it, old boy, what does she want him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beverly&rsquo;s handsome brow was actually furrowed with his problem; and, as I
      certainly could furnish him no solution for it, we stood in silence on the
      post-office steps. &ldquo;What can she want him for?&rdquo; he repeated. Then he threw
      it off lightly with one of his chuckles. &ldquo;So glad I&rsquo;ve no daughters to
      marry! Well&mdash;I must go draw some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took himself off with a certain alacrity, giving an impatient cut with
      his stick at a sparrow in the middle of Worship Street, nor did I see him
      again this day, although, after hurriedly getting my letters (for the
      starting hour of the boat had now drawn near), I followed where he had
      gone down Court Street, and his cosmopolitan figure would have been easy
      to descry at any distance along that scantily peopled pavement. He had
      evidently found the bank and was getting his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      David of the yellow heir and his limpid-looking bride were on the horrible
      little excursion boat, watching for me and keeping with some difficulty a
      chair next themselves that I might not have to stand up all the way; and,
      as I came aboard, the bride called out to me her relief, she had made sure
      that I would be late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David said you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she announced in her clear up-country accent
      across the parasols and heads of huddled tourists, &ldquo;but I told him a
      gentleman that&rsquo;s late to three meals aivry day like as not would forget
      boats can&rsquo;t be kept hot in the kitchen for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took my place in the chair beside her as hastily as possible, for there
      is nothing that I so much dislike as being made conspicuous for any reason
      whatever; and my thanks to her were, I fear, less gracious in their manner
      than should have been the case. Nor did she find me, I must suppose, as
      companionable during this excursion&mdash;during the first part of it, at
      any rate&mdash;as a limpid-looking bride, who has kept at some pains a
      seat beside her for a single gentleman, has the right to expect; the brief
      hours of this morning had fed my preoccupation too richly, and I must
      often have fallen silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horrible little tug, or ferry, or wherry, or whatever its contemptible
      inconvenience makes it fitting that this unclean and snail-like craft
      should be styled, cast off and began to lumber along the edges of the town
      with its dense cargo of hats and parasols and lunch parcels. We were a
      most extraordinary litter of man and womankind. There was the severe New
      England type, improving each shining hour, and doing it in bleak costume
      and with a thoroughly northeast expression; there were pink sunbonnets
      from (I should imagine) Spartanburg, or Charlotte, or Greenville; there
      were masculine boots which yet bore incrusted upon their heels the red mud
      of Aiken or of Camden; there was one fat, jewelled exhalation who spoke of
      Palm Beach with the true stockyard twang, and looked as if she swallowed a
      million every morning for breakfast, and God knows how many more for the
      ensuing repasts; she was the only detestable specimen among us;
      sunbonnets, boots, and even ungenial New England proved on acquaintance
      kindly, simple, enterprising Americans; yet who knows if sunbonnets and
      boots and all of us wouldn&rsquo;t have become just as detestable had we but
      been as she was, swollen and puffy with the acute indigestion of sudden
      wealth?
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection made me charitable, which I always like to be, and I
      imparted it to the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; she said. And I really don&rsquo;t know what that meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently I understood well why people endured the discomfort of this
      journey. I forgot the cinders which now and then showered upon us, and the
      heat of the sun, and the crowded chairs; I forgot the boat and myself, in
      looking at the passing shores. Our course took us round Kings Port on
      three sides. The calm, white town spread out its width and length beneath
      a blue sky softer than the tenderest dream; the white steeples shone
      through the enveloping brightness, taking to each other, and to the
      distant roofs beneath them, successive and changing relations, while the
      dwindling mass of streets and edifices followed more slowly the veering of
      the steeples, folded upon itself, and refolded, opened into new shapes and
      closed again, dwindling always, and always white and beautiful; and as the
      far-off vision of it held the eye, the few masts along the wharves grew
      thin and went out into invisibility, the spires became as masts, the
      distant drawbridge through which we had passed sank down into a mere
      stretching line, and shining Kings Port was dissolved in the blue of water
      and of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curving and the narrowing of the river took it at last from view; and
      after it disappeared the spindling chimneys and their smoke, which were
      along the bank above the town and bridge, leaving us to progress through
      the solitude of marsh and wood and shore. The green levels of stiff salt
      grass closed in upon the breadth of water, and we wound among them,
      looking across their silence to the deeper silence of the woods that
      bordered them, the brooding woods, the pines and the liveoaks, misty with
      the motionless hanging moss, and misty also in that Southern air that
      deepened when it came among their trunks to a caressing, mysterious,
      purple veil. Every line of this landscape, the straight forest top, the
      feathery breaks in it of taller trees, the curving marsh, every line and
      every hue and every sound inscrutably spoke sadness. I heard a
      mocking-bird once in some blossoming wild fruit tree that we gradually
      reached and left gradually behind; and more than once I saw other
      blossoms, and the yellow of the trailing jessamine; but the bird could not
      sing the silence away, and spring with all her abundance could not hide
      this spiritual autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreams, a land of dreams, where even the high noon itself was dreamy; a
      melting together of earth and air and water in one eternal gentleness of
      revery! Whence came the melancholy of this? I had seen woods as solitary
      and streams as silent, I had felt nature breathing upon me a greater awe;
      but never before such penetrating and quiet sadness. I only know that this
      is the perpetual mood of those Southern shores, those rivers that wind in
      from the ocean among their narrowing marshes and their hushed forests, and
      that it does not come from any memory of human hopes and disasters, but
      from the elements themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did we move onward, passing in due time another bridge and a few
      dwellings and some excavations, until the river grew quite narrow, and
      there ahead was the landing at Live Oaks, with negroes idly watching for
      us, and a launch beside the bank, and Charley and Hortense Rieppe about to
      step into it. Another man stood up in the launch and talked to them where
      they were on the landing platform, and pointed down the river as we
      approached; but evidently he did not point at us. I looked hastily to see
      what he was indicating to them, but I could see nothing save the solitary
      river winding away between the empty woods and marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this was Hortense Rieppe! It was not wonderful that she had caused
      young John to lose his heart, or, at any rate, his head and his senses;
      nor was it wonderful that Charley, with his little bulging eyes, should
      take her in his launch whenever she would go; the wonderful thing was that
      John, at his age and with his nature, should have got over it&mdash;if he
      had got over it! I felt it tingling in me; any man would. Steel wasp
      indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was slender, and oh, how well dressed! She watched the passengers get
      off the boat, and I could not tell you from that first sight of her what
      her face was like, but only her hair, the sunburnt amber of its masses
      making one think of Tokay or Chateau-Yquem. She was watching me, I felt,
      and then saw; and as soon as I was near she spoke to me without moving,
      keeping one gloved hand lightly posed upon the railing of the platform, so
      that her long arm was bent with perfect ease and grace. I swear that none
      but a female eye could have detected any toboggan fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words dropped with the same calculated deliberation, the same composed
      and rich indifference. &ldquo;These gardens are so beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was her first remark, chosen with some purpose, I knew quite well;
      and I observed that I hoped I was not too late for their full perfection,
      if too late to visit them in her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head slightly toward Charley. &ldquo;We have been enjoying them
      so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was of absorbing interest to feel simultaneously in these brief
      speeches he vouchsafed&mdash;speeches consummate in their inexpressive
      flatness&mdash;the intentional coldness and the latent heat of the
      creature. Since Natchez and Mobile (or whichever of them it had been that
      had witnessed her beginnings) she had encountered many men and women,
      those who could be of use to her and those who could not; and in dealing
      with them she had tempered and chiselled her insolence to a perfect
      instrument, to strike or to shield. And of her greatest gift, also, she
      was entirely aware&mdash;how could she help being, with her evident
      experience? She knew that round her whole form swam a delicious, invisible
      sphere, a distillation that her veriest self sent forth, as gardenias do
      their perfume, moving where she moved and staying where she stayed, and
      compared with which wine was a feeble vapor for a man to get drunk on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flowers are always so delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was her third speech, pronounced just like the others, in a low,
      clear voice&mdash;simplicity arrived at by much well-practiced complexity.
      And she still looked at Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley now responded in his little banker accent. &ldquo;It is a magnificent
      collection.&rdquo; This he said looking at me, and moving a highly polished
      finger-nail along a very slender mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Hortense now for a moment glanced at the mixed company of
      boat-passengers, who were beginning to be led off in pilgrim groups by the
      appointed guides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were warned it would be too crowded,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was looking at her foot. I can&rsquo;t say whether or not the two light
      taps that the foot now gave upon the floor of the landing brought out for
      me a certain impatience which I might otherwise have missed in those last
      words of hers. From Charley it brought out, I feel quite sure, the speech
      which (in some form) she had been expecting from him as her confederate in
      this unwelcome and inopportune interview with me, and which his less
      highly schooled perceptions had not suggested to him until prompted by
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been very glad to include you in our launch party if I had
      known you were coming here to-day,&rdquo; lied little Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo; I murmured; and I fancy that after this Hortense
      hated me worse than ever. Well, why should I play her game? If anybody had
      any claim upon me, was it she? I would get as much diversion as I could
      from this encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hortense had looked at Charley when she spoke for my benefit, and it now
      pleased me very much to look at him when I spoke for hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could almost give up the gardens for the sake of returning with you,&rdquo; I
      said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was most successful in producing a perceptible silence before
      Hortense said, &ldquo;Do come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to say to her, &ldquo;You are quite splendid&mdash;as splendid as you
      look, through and through! You wouldn&rsquo;t have run away from any battle of
      Chattanooga!&rdquo; But what I did say was, &ldquo;These flowers here will fade, but
      may I not hope to see you again in Kings Port?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at me with eyes half closed; half closed for the sake of
      insolence&mdash;and better observation; when eyes like that take on
      drowsiness, you will be wise to leave all your secrets behind you, locked
      up in the bank, or else toss them right down on the open table. Well, I
      tossed mine down, thereto precipitated by a warning from the stranger in
      the launch:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall need all the tide we can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be glad to know,&rdquo; I then said immediately (to Charley, of
      course), &ldquo;that Miss La Heu, whose dog you killed, is back at her work as
      usual this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Charley. &ldquo;If there could be any chance for me to
      replace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss La Heu is her name?&rdquo; inquired Hortense. &ldquo;I did not catch it
      yesterday. She works, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange. She bakes cakes for weddings&mdash;among her
      other activities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So interesting!&rdquo; said Hortense; and bowing to me, she allowed the
      spellbound Charley to help her down into the launch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each step of the few that she had to take was upon unsteady footing, and
      each was taken with slow security and grace, and with a mastery of her
      skirts so complete that they seemed to do it of themselves, falling and
      folding in the soft, delicate curves of discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of not seeming too curious about this party, I turned from
      watching it before the launch had begun to move, and it was immediately
      hidden from me by the bank, so that I did not see it get away. As I
      crossed an open space toward the gardens I found myself far behind the
      other pilgrims, whose wandering bands I could half discern among winding
      walks and bordering bushes. I was soon taken into somewhat reprimanding
      charge by an admirable, if important, negro, who sighted me from a door
      beneath the porch of the house, and advanced upon me speedily. From him I
      learned at once the rule of the place, that strangers were not allowed to
      &ldquo;go loose,&rdquo; as he expressed it; and recognizing the perfect propriety of
      this restriction, I was humble, and even went so far as to put myself
      right with him by quite ample purchases of the beautiful flowers that he
      had for sale; some of these would be excellent for the up-country bride,
      who certainly ought to have repentance from me in some form for my silence
      as we had come up the river: the scenery had caused me most ungallantly to
      forget her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My rule-breaking turned out all to my advantage. The admirable and
      important negro was so pacified by my liberal amends that he not only
      placed the flowers which I had bought in a bucket of water to wait in
      freshness until my tour of the gardens should be finished and the moment
      for me to return upon the boat should arrive, but he also honored me with
      his own special company; and instead of depositing me in one of the groups
      of other travellers, he took me to see the sights alone, as if I were
      somebody too distinguished to receive my impressions with the common herd.
      Thus I was able to linger here and there, and even to return to certain
      points for another look.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not attempt to describe the azaleas at Live Oaks. You will
      understand me quite well, I am sure, when I say that I had heard the
      people at Mrs. Trevise&rsquo;s house talk so much about them, and praise them so
      superlatively, that I was not prepared for much: my experience of life had
      already included quite a number of azaleas. Moreover, my meeting with
      Hortense and Charley had taken me far away from flowers. But when that
      marvelous place burst upon me, I forgot Hortense. I have seen gardens,
      many gardens, in England, in France; in Italy; I have seen what can be
      done in great hothouses, and on great terraces; what can be done under a
      roof, and what can be done in the open air with the aid of architecture
      and sculpture and ornamental land and water; but no horticulture that I
      have seen devised by mortal man approaches the unearthly enchantment of
      the azaleas at Live Oaks. It was not like seeing flowers at all; it was as
      if there, in the heart of the wild and mystic wood, in the gray gloom of
      those trees veiled and muffled in their long webs and skeins of hanging
      moss, a great, magic flame of rose and red and white burned steadily. You
      looked to see it vanish; you could not imagine such a thing would stay.
      All idea of individual petals or species was swept away in this glowing
      maze of splendor, this transparent labyrinth of rose and red and white,
      through which you looked beyond, into the gray gloom of the hanging moss
      and the depths of the wild forest trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned back as often as I could, and to the last I caught glimpses of
      it, burning, glowing, and shining like some miracle, some rainbow
      exorcism, with its flooding fumes of orange-rose and red and white,
      merging magically. It was not until I reached the landing, and made my way
      on board again, that Hortense returned to my thoughts. She hadn&rsquo;t come to
      see the miracle; not she! I knew that better than ever. And who was the
      other man in the launch?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it perfectly elegant!&rdquo; exclaimed the up-country bride. And upon my
      assenting, she made a further declaration to David: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just aivry bit
      as good as the Isle of Champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I discovered to be a comic opera, mounted with spendthrift
      brilliance, which David had taken her to see at the town of Gonzales, just
      before they were married.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we made our way down the bending river she continued to make many
      observations to me in that up-country accent of hers, which is a fashion
      of speech that may be said to differ as widely from the speech of the
      low-country as cotton differs from rice. I began to fear that, in spite of
      my truly good intentions, I was again failing to be as &ldquo;attentive&rdquo; as the
      occasion demanded; and so I presented her with my floral tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was immediately arch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d surely be depriving somebody!&rdquo; and on this
      I got to the full her limpid look.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that this would not be so, and pointed to the other flowers
      I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, after a little more archness, she took them, as she had, of
      course, fully meant to do from the first; she also took a woman&rsquo;s revenge.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be any more lonesome going down than I was coming up,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;David&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; And this led me definitely to conclude that David had
      secured a helpmate who could take care of herself, in spite of the
      limpidity of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A steel wasp? Again that misleading description of Mrs. Weguelin St.
      Michael&rsquo;s, to which, since my early days in Kings Port, my imagination may
      be said to have been harnessed, came back into my mind. I turned its
      injustice over and over beneath the light which the total Hortense now
      shed upon it&mdash;or rather, not the total Hortense, but my whole
      impression of her, as far as I had got; I got a good deal further before
      we had finished. To the slow, soft accompaniment of these gliding river
      shores, where all the shadows had changed since morning, so that new
      loveliness stood revealed at every turn, my thoughts dwelt upon this
      perfected specimen of the latest American moment&mdash;so late that she
      contained nothing of the past, and a great deal of to-morrow. I basked
      myself in the memory of her achieved beauty, her achieved dress, her
      achieved insolence, her luxurious complexity. She was even later than
      those quite late athletic girls, the Amazons of the links, whose big, hard
      football faces stare at one from public windows and from public punts,
      whose giant, manly strides take them over leagues of country and square
      miles of dance-floor, and whose bursting, blatant, immodest health glares
      upon sea-beaches and round supper tables. Hortense knew that even now the
      hour of such is striking, and that the American boy will presently turn
      with relief to a creature who will more clearly remind him that he is a
      man and that she is a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why was the insolence of Hortense offensive, when the insolence of
      Eliza La Heu was not? Both these extremely feminine beings could exercise
      that quality in profusion, whenever they so wished; wherein did the
      difference lie? Perhaps I thought, in the spirit of its exercise; Eliza
      was merely insolent when she happened to feel like it; and man has always
      been able to forgive woman for that&mdash;whether the angels do or not,
      but Hortense, the world-wise, was insolent to all people who could not be
      of use to her; and all I have to say is, that if the angels can forgive
      them, they&rsquo;re welcome; I can&rsquo;t!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I made sure of anything at the landing? Yes; Hortense didn&rsquo;t care for
      Charley in the least, and never would. A woman can stamp her foot at a man
      and love him simultaneously; but those two light taps, and the measure
      that her eyes took of Charley, meant that she must love his possessions
      very much to be able to bear him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, what was her feeling about John Mayrant? As Beverly had said, what
      could she want him for? He hadn&rsquo;t a thing that she valued or needed. His
      old-time notions of decency, the clean simplicity of his make, his good
      Southern position, and his collection of nice old relatives&mdash;what did
      these assets look like from an automobile, or on board the launch of a
      modern steam yacht? And wouldn&rsquo;t it be amusing if John should grow
      needlessly jealous, and have a &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; with Charley? not a mere
      flinging of torn paper money in the banker&rsquo;s face, but some more decided
      punishment for the banker&rsquo;s presuming to rest his predatory eyes upon
      John&rsquo;s affianced lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at the now broadening river, where the reappearance of the
      bridge, and of Kings Port, and the nearer chimneys pouring out their smoke
      a few miles above the town, betokened that our excursion was drawing to
      its end. And then from the chimney&rsquo;s neighborhood, from the waterside
      where their factories stood, there shot out into the smoothness of the
      stream a launch. It crossed into our course ahead of us, preceded us
      quickly, growing soon into a dot, went through the bridge, and so was seen
      no longer; and its occupants must have reached town a good half hour
      before we did. And now, suddenly, I was stunned with a great discovery.
      The bride&rsquo;s voice sounded in my ear. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll always say you&rsquo;re a
      prophet, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her, dull and dazed by the internal commotion the discovery
      had raised in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said we wouldn&rsquo;t get stuck in the mud, and we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the
      bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed to the chimneys. &ldquo;Are those the phosphate works?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yais. Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The V-C phosphate works?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yais. Haven&rsquo;t you been to see them yet? He ought to, oughtn&rsquo;t he,
      David? &lsquo;Specially now they&rsquo;ve found those deposits up the river were just
      as rich as they hoped, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose? Mr. Mayrant&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I asked with such sharpness that the bride was
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      David hadn&rsquo;t attended to the name. It was some trust estate, he thought;
      Regent Tom, or some such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they thought it was no good,&rdquo; said the bride. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s aivry bit as
      good as the Coosaw used to be. Better than Florida or Tennessee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My eyes instinctively turned to where they had last seen the launch; of
      course it wasn&rsquo;t there any more. Then I spoke to David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what a phosphate bed looks like? Can one see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This kind you can,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not worth your trouble. Just a
      kind of a square hole you dig along the river till you strike the stuff.
      What you want to see is the works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, I didn&rsquo;t want to see even the works; they smelt atrociously, and I do
      not care for vats, and acids, and processes: and besides, had I not seen
      enough? My eyes went down the river again where that launch had gone; and
      I wondered if the wedding-cake would be postponed any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regent Tom? Oh, yes, to be sure! John Mayrant had pointed out to me the
      house where he had lived; he had been John&rsquo;s uncle. So the old gentleman
      had left his estate in trust! And now&mdash;! But certainly Hortense would
      have won the battle of Chattanooga!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure about all this,&rdquo; I told myself cautiously. But there
      are times when cautioning one&rsquo;s self is quite as useless as if somebody
      else had cautioned one; my reason leaped with the rapidity of intuition; I
      merely sat and looked on at what it was doing. All sorts of odds and ends,
      words I hadn&rsquo;t understood, looks and silences I hadn&rsquo;t interpreted, little
      signs that I had thought nothing of at first, but which I had gradually,
      through their multiplicity, come to know meant something, all these broken
      pieces fitted into each other now, fell together and made a clear pattern
      of the truth, without a crack in it&mdash;Hortense had never believed in
      that story about the phosphates having failed&mdash;&ldquo;pinched out,&rdquo; as they
      say of ore deposits. There she had stood between her two suitors, between
      her affianced John and the besieging Charley, and before she would be off
      with the old love and on with the new, she must personally look into those
      phosphates. Therefore she had been obliged to have a sick father and
      postpone the wedding two or three times, because her affairs&mdash;very
      likely the necessity of making certain of Charley&mdash;had prevented her
      from coming sooner to Kings Port. And having now come hither, and having
      beheld her Northern and her Southern lovers side by side&mdash;had the
      comparison done something to her highly controlled heart? Was love taking
      some hitherto unknown liberties with that well-balanced organ? But what an
      outrage had been perpetrated upon John! At that my deductions staggered in
      their rapid course. How could his aunts&mdash;but then it had only been
      one of them; Miss Josephine had never approved of Miss Eliza&rsquo;s course; it
      was of that that Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael had so emphatically reminded
      Mrs. Gregory in my presence when we had strolled together upon High Walk,
      and those two ladies had talked oracles in my presence. Well, they were
      oracles no longer!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boat brought us back to the wharf, there were the rest of my
      flowers unbestowed, and upon whom should I bestow them? I thought first of
      Eliza La Heu, but she wouldn&rsquo;t be at the Exchange so late as this. Then it
      seemed well to carry them to Mrs. Weguelin. Something, however, prompted
      me to pass her door, and continue vaguely walking on until I came to the
      house where Miss Josephine and Miss Eliza lived; and here I rang the bell
      and was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting as I had seen them first, the one with her embroidery,
      and the other on the further side of a table, whereon lay an open letter,
      which in a few moments I knew must have been the subject of the discussion
      which they finished even as I came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only prolonging an honest mistake.&rdquo; That was Miss Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it has merely resulted in clinching what you meant it to finish.&rdquo;
       That was Miss Josephine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid my flowers upon the table, and saw that the letter was in John
      Mayrant&rsquo;s hand. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      I avoided looking at it again; but what had he written, and why had he
      written? His daily steps turned to this house&mdash;unless Miss Josephine
      had banished him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies accepted my offering with gracious expressions, and while I
      told them of my visit to Live Oaks, and poured out my enthusiasm, the
      servant was sent for and brought water and two beautiful old china bowls,
      in which Miss Eliza proceeded to arrange the flowers with her delicate
      white hands. She made them look exquisite with an old lady&rsquo;s art, and this
      little occupation went on as we talked of indifferent subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the atmosphere of that room was charged with the subject of which we
      did not speak. The letter lay on the table; and even as I struggled to
      sustain polite conversation, I began to know what was in it, though I
      never looked at it again; it spoke out as clearly to me as the launch had
      done. I had thought, when I first entered, to tell the ladies something of
      my meeting with Hortense Rieppe; I can only say that I found this
      impossible. Neither of them referred to her, or to John, or to anything
      that approached what we were all thinking of; for me to do so would have
      assumed the dimensions of a liberty; and in consequence of this state of
      things, constraint sat upon us all, growing worse, and so pervading our
      small-talk with discomfort that I made my visit a very short one. Of
      course they were civil about this when I rose, and begged me not to go so
      soon; but I knew better. And even as I was getting my hat and gloves in
      the hall I could tell by their tones that they had returned to the subject
      of that letter. But in truth they had never left it; as the front door
      shut behind me I felt as if they had read it aloud to me.

    <h2>
      XVI: The Steel Wasp
    </h2>
    <p>
      Certainly Hortense Rieppe would have won the battle of Chattanooga! I know
      not from which parent that young woman inherited her gift of strategy, but
      she was a master. To use the resources of one lover in order to ascertain
      if another lover had any; to lay tribute on everything that Charley
      possessed; on his influence in the business world, which enabled him to
      walk into the V-C Chemical Company&rsquo;s office and borrow an expert in the
      phosphate line; on his launch in which to pop the expert and take him up
      the river, and see in his company and learn from his lips just what
      resources of worldly wealth were likely to be in-store for John Mayrant;
      and finally (which was the key to all the rest) on his inveterate passion
      for her, on his banker-like determination through all the thick and thin
      of discouragement, and worse than discouragement, of contemptuous
      coquetry, to possess her at any cost he could afford;&mdash;to use all
      this that Charley had, in order that she might judiciously arrive at the
      decision whether she would take him or his rival, left one lost in
      admiration. And then, not to waste a moment! To reach town one evening,
      and next morning by ten o&rsquo;clock to have that expert safe in the launch on
      his way up the river to the phosphate diggings! The very audacity of such
      unscrupulousness commanded my respect: successful dishonor generally wins
      louder applause than successful virtue. But to be married to her! Oh! not
      for worlds! Charley might meet such emergency, but poor John, never!
    </p>
    <p>
      I nearly walked into Mrs. Weguelin and Mrs. Gregory taking their customary
      air slowly in South Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why a steel wasp?&rdquo; I said at once to Mrs. Weguelin. It was a more
      familiar way of beginning with the little, dignified lady than would have
      been at all possible, or suitable, if we had not had that little joke
      about the piano snobile between us. As it was, she was not wholly
      displeased. These Kings Port old ladies grew, I suspect, very slowly and
      guardedly accustomed to any outsider; they allowed themselves very seldom
      to suffer any form of abruptness from him, or from any one, for that
      matter. But, once they were reassured as to him, then they might sometimes
      allow the privileged person certain departures from their own rule of
      deportment, because his conventions were recognized to be different from
      theirs. Moreover, in reminding Mrs. Weguelin of the steel wasp, I had put
      my abruptness in &ldquo;quotations,&rdquo; so to speak, by the tone I gave it, just as
      people who are particular in speech can often interpolate a word of
      current slang elegantly by means of the shade of emphasis which they lay
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Weguelin smiled and her dark eyes danced a little. &ldquo;You remember I
      said that, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember everything that you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you seen of the creature?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Gregory, with her
      head pretty high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m seeing more, and more, and more every minute. She&rsquo;s rather
      endless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weguelin looked reproachful. &ldquo;You surely cannot admire her, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory hadn&rsquo;t understood me. &ldquo;Oh, if you really can keep her away,
      you&rsquo;re welcome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only meant,&rdquo; I explained to the ladies, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t really begin to
      see her till you have seen her: it&rsquo;s afterward, when you&rsquo;re out of reach
      of the spell.&rdquo; And I told them of the interview which I had not been able
      to tell to Miss Josephine and Miss Eliza. &ldquo;I doubt if it lasted more than
      four minutes,&rdquo; I assured them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up the river?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Gregory
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the landing,&rdquo; I repeated. And the ladies consulted each other&rsquo;s
      expressions. But that didn&rsquo;t bother me any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can admire her?&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I tell you exactly, precisely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do!&rdquo; they both exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think many wise men would find her immensely desirable&mdash;as
      somebody else&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this remark Mrs. Weguelin dropped her eyes, but I knew they were
      dancing beneath their lids. &ldquo;I should not have permitted myself to say
      that, but I am glad that it has been said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory turned to her companion. &ldquo;Shall we call to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel it must be done?&rdquo; returned Mrs. Weguelin, and then she
      addressed me. &ldquo;Do you know a Mr. Beverly Rodgers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him a golden recommendation and took my leave of the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were going to do the handsome thing; they would ring the
      Cornerlys&rsquo; bell; they would cross the interloping threshold, they would
      recognize the interloping girl; and this meant that they had given it up.
      It meant that Miss Eliza had given it up, too, had at last abandoned her
      position that the marriage would never take place. And her own act had
      probably drawn this down upon her. When the trustee of that estate had
      told her of the apparent failure of the phosphates, she had hailed it as
      an escape for her beloved John, and for all of them, because she made sure
      that Hortense would never marry a virtually penniless man. And when the
      work went on, and the rich fortune was unearthed after all, her influence
      had caused that revelation to be delayed because she was so confident that
      the engagement would be broken. But she had reckoned without Hortense;
      worse than that, she had reckoned without John Mayrant; in her meddling
      attempt to guide his affairs in the way that she believed would be best
      for him, she forgot that the boy whom she had brought up was no longer a
      child, and thus she unpardonably ignored his rights as a man. And now Miss
      Josephine&rsquo;s disapproval was vindicated, and her own casuistry was doubly
      punished. Miss Rieppe&rsquo;s astute journey of investigation&mdash;for her
      purpose had evidently become suspected by some of them beforehand&mdash;had
      forced Miss Eliza to disclose the truth about the phosphates to her nephew
      before it should be told him by the girl herself; and the intolerable
      position of apparent duplicity precipitated two wholly inevitable actions
      on his part; he had bound himself more than ever to marry Hortense, and he
      had made a furious breach with his Aunt Eliza. That was what his letter
      had contained; this time he had banished himself from that house. What was
      his Aunt Eliza going to do about it? I wondered. She was a stiff, if
      indiscreet, old lady, and it certainly did not fall within her view of the
      proprieties that young people should take their elders to task in furious
      letters. But she had been totally in the wrong, and her fault was
      irreparable, because important things had happened in consequence of it;
      she might repent the fault in sackcloth and ashes, but she couldn&rsquo;t stop
      the things. Would she, then, honorably wear the sackcloth, or would she
      dishonestly shirk it under the false issue of her nephew&rsquo;s improper tone
      to her? Women can justify themselves with more appalling skill than men.
    </p>
    <p>
      One drop there was in all this bitter bucket, which must have tasted sweet
      to John. He had resigned from the Custom House: Juno had got it right this
      time, though she hadn&rsquo;t a notion of the real reason for John&rsquo;s act. This
      act had been, since morning, lost for me, so to speak, in the shuffle of
      more absorbing events; and it now rose to view again in my mind as a
      telling stroke in the full-length portrait that all his acts had been
      painting of the boy during the last twenty-four hours. Notwithstanding a
      meddlesome aunt, and an arriving sweetheart, and imminent wedlock, he
      hadn&rsquo;t forgotten to stop &ldquo;taking orders from a negro&rdquo; at the very first
      opportunity which came to him; his phosphates had done this for him, at
      least, and I should have the pleasure of correcting Juno at tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not have this pleasure. They were all in an excitement over
      something else, and my own different excitement hadn&rsquo;t a chance against
      this greater one; for people seldom wish to hear what you have to say,
      even under the most favorable circumstances, and never when they have
      anything to say themselves. With an audience so hotly preoccupied I
      couldn&rsquo;t have sat on Juno effectively at all, and therefore I kept it to
      myself, and attended very slightly to what they were telling me about the
      Daughters of Dixie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed absently to the poetess. &ldquo;And your poem?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A great
      success, I am sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you hear me say so?&rdquo; said the upcountry bride; and then,
      after a smile at the others, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your flowers were graciously
      accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Miss Josephine St. Michael,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; went the bride. &ldquo;How would she know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave myself no pains to improve or arrest this tiresome joke, and they
      went back to their Daughters of Dixie; but it is rather singular how
      sometimes an utterly absurd notion will be the cause of our taking a step
      which we had not contemplated. I did carry some flowers to Miss La Heu the
      next day. I was at some trouble to find any; for in Kings Port shops of
      this kind are by no means plentiful, and it was not until I had paid a
      visit to a quite distant garden at the extreme northwestern edge of the
      town that I lighted upon anything worthy of the girl behind the counter.
      The Exchange itself was apt to have flowers for sale, but I hardly saw my
      way to buying them there, and then immediately offering them to the fair
      person who had sold them to me. As it was, I did much better; for what I
      brought her were decidedly superior to any that were at the Exchange when
      I entered it at lunch time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, as the up-country bride would have put it, &ldquo;graciously
      accepted.&rdquo; Miss La Heu stood them in water on the counter beside her
      ledger. She was looking lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected you yesterday,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The new Lady Baltimore was ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it is not all eaten yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Not a slice gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, nobody does your art justice here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and sit down at your table, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was really quite difficult to say to her from that distance the sort of
      things that I wished to say; but there seemed to be no help for it, and I
      did my best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss my lunches here very much when I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say coffee to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chocolate. I shall miss&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the lettuce sandwiches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You don&rsquo;t realize how much these lunches&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have cost you?&rdquo; She seemed determined to keep laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it. They have cost me my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you the receipt, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The receipt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Lady Baltimore, to take with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to give me a receipt for a lost heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, his heart! General, listen to&mdash;&rdquo; From habit she had turned to
      where her dog used to lie; and sudden pain swept over her face and was
      mastered. &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; she quickly resumed. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak about it.
      And you have a heart somewhere; for it was very nice in you to come in
      yesterday morning after&mdash;after the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have a heart,&rdquo; I began, rising; for, really, I could not go on
      in this way, sitting down away back at the lunch table.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the door opened, and Hortense Rieppe came into the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at me that she first looked, and she gave me the slightest bow
      possible, the least sign of conventional recognition that a movement of
      the head could make and be visible at all; she didn&rsquo;t bend her head down,
      she tilted it ever so little up. It wasn&rsquo;t new to me, this form of
      greeting, and I knew that she had acquired it at Newport, and that it
      denoted, all too accurately, the size of my importance in her eyes; she
      did it, as she did everything, with perfection. Then she turned to Eliza
      La Heu, whose face had become miraculously sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Hortense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounded from a quiet well of reserve music; just a cupful of melodious
      tone dipped lightly out of the surface. Her face hadn&rsquo;t become anything;
      but it was equally miraculous in its total void of all expression relating
      to this moment, or to any moment; just her beauty, her permanent
      stationary beauty, was there glowing in it and through it, not skin deep,
      but going back and back into her lazy eyes, and shining from within the
      modulated bloom of her color and the depths of her amber hair. She was
      choosing, for this occasion, to be as impersonal as some radiant hour in
      nature, some mellow, motionless day when the leaves have turned, but have
      not fallen, and it is drowsily warm; but it wasn&rsquo;t so much of nature that
      she, in her harmonious lustre, reminded me, as of some beautiful
      silken-shaded lamp, from which color rather than light came with subdued
      ampleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw her eyes settle upon the flowers that I had brought Eliza La Heu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful those are!&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there something that you wish?&rdquo; inquired Miss La Heu, always
      miraculously sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of your good things for lunch; a very little, if you will be so
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had gone back to my table while the &ldquo;very little&rdquo; was being selected,
      and I felt, in spite of how slightly she counted me, that it would be
      inadequate in me to remain completely dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mayrant is still at the Custom House?&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a few days, yes. Happily we shall soon break that connection.&rdquo; And
      she smelt my flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We,&rsquo;&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;is rather tremendous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It grew more tremendous in the silence as Eliza La Heu brought me my
      orders. Miss Rieppe did not seat herself to take the light refreshment
      which she found enough for lunch. Her plate and cup were set for her, but
      she walked about, now with one, and now with the other, taking her time
      over it, and pausing here and there at some article of the Exchange stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, she hadn&rsquo;t come there for any lunch; the Cornerlys had midday
      lunch and dined late; these innovated hours were a part of Kings Port&rsquo;s
      deep suspicion of the Cornerlys; but what now became interesting was her
      evident indifference to our perceiving that lunch was merely a pretext
      with her; in fact, I think she wished it to be perceived, and I also think
      that those turns which she took about the Exchange&mdash;her apparent
      inspection of an old mahogany table, her examination of a pewter set&mdash;were
      a symbol (and meant to be a symbol) of how she had all the time there was,
      and the possession of everything she wished including the situation, and
      that she enjoyed having this sink in while she was rearranging whatever
      she had arranged to say, in consequence of finding that I should also hear
      it. And how well she was worth looking at, no matter whether she stood, or
      moved, or what she did! Her age lay beyond the reach of the human eye; if
      she was twenty-five, she was marvelous in her mastery of her appearance;
      if she was thirty-four, she was marvelous in her mastery of perpetuating
      it, and by no other means than perfect dress personal to herself (for she
      had taken the fashion and welded it into her own plasticity) and perfect
      health; for without a trace of the athletic, her graceful shape teemed
      with elasticity. There was a touch of &ldquo;sport&rdquo; in the parasol she had laid
      down; and with all her blended serenity there was a touch of &ldquo;sport&rdquo; in
      her. Experience could teach her beauty nothing more; it wore the look of
      having been made love to by many married men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly the true light flashed upon me. I had been slow-sighted
      indeed! So that was what she had come here for to-day! Miss Hortense was
      going to pay her compliments to Miss La Heu. I believe that my sight might
      still have been slow but for that miraculous sweetness upon the face of
      Eliza. She was ready for the compliments! Well, I sat expectant&mdash;and
      disappointment was by no means my lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hortense finished her lunch. &ldquo;And so this interesting place is where you
      work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza, thus addressed, assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you furnish wedding cakes also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was continuously and miraculously sweet. &ldquo;The Exchange includes
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hope you will be present to taste some of yours on the day it is
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall accept the invitation if my friends send me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No blood flowed from Hortense at this, and she continued with the same
      smooth deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The list is of necessity very small; but I shall see that it includes
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to postpone it any more, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No blood flowed at this, either. &ldquo;I doubt if John&mdash;if Mr. Mayrant&mdash;would
      brook further delay, and my father seems stronger, at last. How much do I
      owe you for your very good food?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a pity that a larger audience could not have been there to enjoy
      this skilful duet, for it held me hanging on every musical word of it.
      There, at the far back end of the long room, I sat alone at my table,
      pretending to be engaged over a sandwich that was no more in existence&mdash;external,
      I mean&mdash;and a totally empty cup of chocolate. I lifted the cup, and
      bowed over the plate, and used the paper Japanese napkin, and generally
      went through the various discreet paces of eating, quite breathless, all
      the while, to know which of them was coming out ahead. There was no
      fairness in their positions; Hortense had Eliza in a cage, penned in by
      every fact; but it doesn&rsquo;t do to go too near some birds, even when they&rsquo;re
      caged, and, while these two birds had been giving their sweet
      manifestations of song, Eliza had driven a peck or two home through the
      bars, which, though they did not draw visible blood, as I have said,
      probably taught Hortense that a Newport education is not the only
      instruction which fits you for drawing-room war to the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her small reckoning was paid, and she had drawn on one long, tawny glove.
      Even this act was a luxury to watch, so full it was of the feminine, of
      the stretching, indolent ease that the flesh and the spirit of this
      creature invariably seemed to move with. But why didn&rsquo;t she go? This
      became my wonder now, while she slowly drew on the second glove. She was
      taking more time than it needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your flowers are for sale, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, after her silence, struck me as being something planned out after
      her original plan. The original plan had finished with that second
      assertion of her ownership of John (or, I had better say, of his ownership
      in her), that doubt she had expressed as to his being willing to consent
      to any further postponement of their marriage. Of course she had expected,
      and got herself ready for, some thrust on the postponement subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza crossed from behind her counter to where the Exchange flowers stood
      on the opposite side of the room and took some of them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those are inferior,&rdquo; said Hortense. &ldquo;These.&rdquo; And she touched rightly
      the bowl in which my roses stood close beside Eliza&rsquo;s ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza paused for one second. &ldquo;Those are not for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense paused, too. Then she hung to it. &ldquo;They are so much the best.&rdquo;
       She was holding her purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said Eliza. &ldquo;But I cannot let any one have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense put her purse away. &ldquo;You know best. Shall you furnish us flowers
      as well as cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza&rsquo;s sweetness rose an octave, softer and softer. &ldquo;Why, they have
      flowers there! Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to this last and frightful peck through the bars Hortense found no
      retaliation. With a bow to Eliza, and a total oblivion of me, she went out
      of the Exchange. She had flaunted &ldquo;her&rdquo; John in Eliza&rsquo;s face, she had, as
      they say, rubbed it in that he was &ldquo;her&rdquo; John;&mdash;but was it such a
      neat, tidy victory, after all? She had given away the last word to Eliza,
      presented her with that poisonous speech which when translated meant:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s &lsquo;your&rsquo; John; and you&rsquo;re climbing up him into houses where you&rsquo;d
      otherwise be arrested for trespass.&rdquo; For it was in one of the various St.
      Michael houses that the marriage would be held, owing to the nomadic state
      of the Rieppes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Hortense had gone altogether too close to the cage at the end, and,
      in that repetition of her taunt about &ldquo;furnishing&rdquo; supplies for the
      wedding, she had at length betrayed something which her skill and the
      intricate enamel of her experience had hitherto, and with entire success,
      concealed&mdash;namely, the latent vulgarity of the woman. She was
      wearing, for the sake of Kings Port, her best behavior, her most knowing
      form, and, indeed it was a well-done imitation of the real thing; it would
      last through most occasions, and it would deceive most people. But here
      was the trouble: she was wearing it; while, through the whole encounter,
      Eliza La Heu had worn nothing but her natural and perfect dignity; yet
      with that disadvantage (for good breeding, alas!, is at times a sort of
      disadvantage, and can be battered down and covered with mud so that its
      own fine grain is invisible) Eliza had, after a somewhat undecisive
      battle, got in that last frightful peck! But what had led Hortense, after
      she had come through pretty well, to lose her temper and thus, at the
      finish, expose to Eliza her weakest position? That her clothes were paid
      for by a Newport lady who had taken her to Worth, that her wedding feast
      was to be paid for by the bridegroom, these were not facts which Eliza
      would deign to use as weapons; but she was marrying inside the doors of
      Eliza&rsquo;s Kings Port, that had never opened to admit her before, and she had
      slipped into putting this chance into Eliza&rsquo;s hand&mdash;and how had she
      come to do this?
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, my vision had been slow! Hortense had seen, through her thick
      veil, Eliza&rsquo;s interest in John in the first minute of her arrival on the
      bridge, that minute when John had run up to Eliza after the automobile had
      passed over poor General. And Hortense had not revealed herself at once,
      because she wanted a longer look at them. Well, she had got it, and she
      had got also a look at her affianced John when he was in the fire-eating
      mood, and had displayed the conduct appropriate to 1840, while Charley&rsquo;s
      display had been so much more modern. And so first she had prudently
      settled that awkward phosphate difficulty, and next she had paid this
      little visit to Eliza in order to have the pleasure of telling her in four
      or five different ways, and driving it in deep, and turning it round:
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you may get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all clear as day,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;But what does her loss of
      temper mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was writing at her ledger. The sweetness hadn&rsquo;t entirely gone; it
      was too soon for that, and besides, she knew I must be looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have told her they were my flowers?&rdquo; I asked her at the
      counter, as I prepared to depart. Eliza did not look up from her ledger.
      &ldquo;Do you think she would have believed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out!&rdquo; she interrupted imperiously and with a stamp of her foot.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here long enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine my amazement at this. It was not until I had reached Mrs.
      Trevise&rsquo;s, and was sitting down to answer a note which had been left for
      me, that light again came. Hortense Rieppe had thought those flowers were
      from John Mayrant, and Eliza had let her think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was light, a good bright light shed on the matter; but a still
      more brilliant beam was cast by the up-country bride when I came into the
      dining-room. I told her myself, at once, that I had taken flowers to Miss
      La Heu; I preferred she should hear this from me before she learned it
      from the smiling lips of gossip. It surprised me that she should
      immediately inquire what kind of flowers?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, roses,&rdquo; I answered; and she went into peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray share the jest,&rdquo; I begged her with some dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the language that roses from a single
      gentleman to a young lady speak in Kings Port?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood staring and stiff, taking it in, taking myself, and Eliza, and
      Hortense, and the implicated John, all in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, aivrybody in Kings Port knows that!&rdquo; said the bride; and now my
      mirth rose even above hers.

      XVII: Doing the Handsome Thing
    </h2>
    <p>
      It by no means lessened my pleasure to discern that Hortense must feel
      herself to be in a predicament; and as I sat writing my answer to the
      note, which was from Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael and contained an invitation
      to me for the next afternoon, I thought of those pilots whose dangers have
      come down to us from distant times through the songs of ancient poets. The
      narrow and tempestuous channel between Scylla and Charybdis bristled
      unquestionably with violent problems, but with none, I should suppose,
      that called for a nicer hand upon the wheel, or an eye more alert, than
      this steering of your little trireme to a successful marriage, between one
      man who believed himself to be your destined bridegroom and another who
      expected to be so, meanwhile keeping each in ignorance of how close you
      were sailing to the other. In Hortense&rsquo;s place I should have wished to
      hasten the wedding now, have it safely performed this afternoon, say, or
      to-morrow morning; thus precipitated by some invaluable turn in the health
      of her poor dear father. But she had worn it out, his health, by playing
      it for decidedly as much as it could bear; it couldn&rsquo;t be used again
      without risk; the date must stand fixed; and, uneasy as she might have
      begun to be about John, Hortense must, with no shortening of the course,
      get her boat in safe without smashing it against either John or Charley. I
      wondered a little that she should feel any uncertainty about her affianced
      lover. She must know how much his word was to him, and she had had his
      word twice, given her the second time to put his own honor right with her
      on the score of the phosphates. But perhaps Hortense&rsquo;s rich experiences of
      life had taught her that a man&rsquo;s word to a woman should not be subjected
      to the test of another woman&rsquo;s advent. On the whole, I suppose it was
      quite natural those flowers should annoy her, and equally natural that
      Eliza, the minx, should allow them to do so! There&rsquo;s a joy to the marrow
      in watching your enemy harried and discomfited by his own gratuitous
      contrivances; you look on serenely at a show which hasn&rsquo;t cost you a
      groat. However, poor Eliza had not been so serene at the very end, when
      she stormed out at me. For this I did not have to forgive her, of course,
      little as I had merited such treatment. Had she not accepted my flowers?
      But it was a gratification to reflect that in my sentimental passages with
      her I had not gone to any great length; nothing, do I ever find, is so
      irksome as the sense of having unwittingly been in a false position. Was
      John, on his side, in love with her? Was it possible he would fail in his
      word? So with these thoughts, while answering and accepting Mrs. Weguelin
      St. Michael&rsquo;s invitation to make one of a party of strangers to whom she
      was going to show another old Kings Port church, &ldquo;where many of my
      ancestors lie,&rdquo; as her note informed me, I added one sentence which had
      nothing to do with the subject &ldquo;She is a steel wasp,&rdquo; I ventured to say.
      And when on the next afternoon I met the party at the church, I received
      from the little lady a look of highly spiced comprehension as she gently
      remarked, &ldquo;I was glad to get your acceptance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I went down to the dinner-table, Juno sat in her best clothes, still
      discussing the Daughters of Dixie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t say that I took much more heed of this at dinner than I had done
      at tea; but I was interested to hear Juno mention that she, too, intended
      to call upon Hortense Rieppe. Kings Port, she said, must take a consistent
      position; and for her part, so far as behavior went, she didn&rsquo;t see much
      to choose between the couple. &ldquo;As to whether Mr. Mayrant had really
      concealed the discovery of his fortune,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I asked Miss
      Josephine&mdash;in a perfectly nice way, of course. But old Mr. St.
      Michael Beaugarcon, who has always had the estate in charge, did that. It
      is only a life estate, unless Mr. Mayrant has lawful issue. Well, he will
      have that now, and all that money will be his to squander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Carola had written me again this morning, but I had been in no haste
      to open her letter; my neglect of the Bombos did not weigh too heavily
      upon me, I fear, but I certainly did put off reading what I expected to be
      a reprimand. And concerning this I was right; her first words betokened
      reprimand at once. &ldquo;My dear nephew Augustus,&rdquo; she began, in her fine,
      elegant handwriting. That was always her mode of address to me when
      something was coming, while at other times it would be, less portentously,
      &ldquo;My dear Augustus,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My dear nephew &ldquo;; but whenever my name and my
      relationship to her occurred conjointly, I took the communication away
      with me to some corner, and opened it in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t about the Bombos, though; and for what she took me to task I was
      able to defend myself, I think, quite adequately. She found fault with me
      for liking the South too much, and this she based upon the enthusiastic
      accounts of Kings Port and its people that I had written to her; nor had
      she at all approved of my remarks on the subject of the negro, called
      forth by Daddy Ben and his grandson Charles Cotesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I sent you (wrote Aunt Carola) to admire Kings Port good-breeding, I
      did not send you to forget your country. Remember that those people were
      its mortal enemies; that besides their treatment of our prisoners in Libby
      and Andersonville (which killed my brother Alexander) they displayed in
      their dealings, both social and political, an arrogance in success and a
      childish petulance at opposition, which we who saw and suffered can never
      forget, any more than we can forget our loved ones who laid down their
      lives for this cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were not the only words with which Aunt Carola reproved what she
      termed my &ldquo;disloyalty,&rdquo; but they will serve to indicate her feeling about
      the Civil War. It was&mdash;on her side&mdash;precisely the feeling of all
      the Kings Port old ladies on Heir side. But why should it be mine? And so,
      after much thinking how I might best reply respectfully yet say to Aunt
      Carola what my feeling was, I sat down upstairs at my window, and, after
      some preliminary sentences, wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are dead brothers here also, who, like your brother, laid down
      their lives for what they believed was their country, and whom their
      sisters never can forget as you can never forget him. I read their names
      upon sad church tablets, and their boy faces look out at me from cherished
      miniatures and dim daguerreotypes. Upon their graves the women who mourn
      them leave flowers as you leave flowers upon the grave of your young
      soldier. You will tell me, perhaps, that since the bereavement is equal, I
      have not justified my sympathy for these people. But the bereavement was
      not equal. More homes here were robbed by death of their light and promise
      than with us; and to this you must add the material desolation of the
      homes themselves. Our roofs were not laid in ashes, and to-day we sit in
      affluence while they sit in privation. You will say to this, perhaps, that
      they brought it upon themselves. But even granting that they did so,
      surely to suffer and to lose is more bitter than to suffer and to win. My
      dear aunt, you could not see what I have seen here, and write to me as you
      do; and if those years have left upon your heart a scar which will not
      vanish, do not ask me, who came afterward, to wear the scar also. I should
      then resemble certain of the younger ones here, with less excuse than is
      theirs. As for the negro, forgive me if I assure you that you retain an
      Abolitionist exaltation for a creature who does not exist, or whose
      existence is an ineffectual drop in the bucket, a creature on grateful
      knees raising faithful eyes to one who has struck off his chains of
      slavery, whereas the creature who does exist is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused here in my letter to Aunt Carola, and sought for some fitting
      expression that should characterize for her with sufficient severity the
      new type of deliberately worthless negro; and as I sought, my eyes
      wandered to the garden next door, the garden of the Cornerlys. On a bench
      near a shady arrangement of vines over bars sat Hortense Rieppe. She was
      alone, and, from her attitude, seemed to be thinking deeply. The high
      walls of the garden shut her into a privacy that her position near the
      shady vines still more increased. It was evident that she had come here
      for the sake of being alone, and I regretted that she was so turned from
      me that I could not see her face. But her solitude did not long continue;
      there came into view a gentleman of would-be venerable appearance, who
      approached her with a walk carefully constructed for public admiration,
      and who, upon reaching her, bent over with the same sort of footlight
      elaboration and gave her a paternal kiss. I did not need to hear her call
      him father; he was so obviously General Rieppe, the prudent hero of
      Chattanooga, that words would have been perfectly superfluous in his
      identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was destined upon another day to hear the tones of his voice, and
      thereupon may as well state now that they belonged altogether with the
      rest of him. There is a familiar type of Northern fraud, and a Southern
      type, equally familiar, but totally different in appearance. The Northern
      type has the straight, flat, earnest hair, the shaven upper lip, the
      chin-beard, and the benevolent religious expression. He will be the
      president of several charities, and the head of one great business. He
      plays no cards, drinks no wine, and warns young men to beware of
      temptation. He is as genial as a hair-sofa; and he is seldom found out by
      the public unless some financial crash in general affairs uncovers his
      cheating, which lies most often beyond the law&rsquo;s reach; and because he
      cannot be put in jail, he quite honestly believes heaven is his
      destination. We see less of him since we have ceased to be a religious
      country, religion no longer being an essential disguise for him. The
      Southern type, with his unction and his juleps, is better company, unless
      he is the hero of too many of his own anecdotes. He is commonly the
      possessor of a poetic gaze, a mane of silvery hair, and a noble neck. As
      war days and cotton-factor days recede into a past more and more filmed
      over with romance, he too grows rare among us, and I regret it, for he was
      in truth a picturesque figure. General Rieppe was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I was sorry that the distance they were from me rendered hearing
      what they were saying impossible; very soon, however, the frame of my open
      window provided me with a living picture which would have been actually
      spoiled had the human voice disturbed its eloquent pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Rieppe&rsquo;s daughter responded to her father&rsquo;s caress but languidly,
      turning to him her face, with its luminous, stationary beauty. He pointed
      to the house, and then waved his hand toward the bench where she sat; and
      she, in response to this, nodded slightly. Upon which the General, after
      another kiss of histrionic paternity administered to her forehead, left
      her sitting and proceeded along the garden walk at a stately pace, until I
      could no longer see him. Hortense, left alone upon the bench, looked down
      at the folds of her dress, extended a hand and slowly rearranged one of
      them, and then, with the same hand, felt her hair from front to back. This
      had scarce been accomplished when the General reappeared, ushering Juno
      along the walk, and bearing a chair with him. When they turned the corner
      at the arbor, Hortense rose, and greetings ensued. Few objects could be
      straighter than was Juno&rsquo;s back; her card-case was in her hand, but her
      pocket was not quite large enough for the whole of her pride, which stuck
      out so that it could have been seen from a greater distance than my
      window. The General would have departed, placing his chair for the
      visitor, when Hortense waved for him an inviting hand toward the bench
      beside her; he waved a similarly inviting hand, looking at Juno, who
      thereupon sat firmly down upon the chair. At this the General hovered
      heavily, looking at his daughter, who gave him no look in return, as she
      engaged in conversation with Juno; and presently the General left them.
      Juno&rsquo;s back and Hortense&rsquo;s front, both entirely motionless as they
      interviewed each other&rsquo; presented a stiff appearance, with Juno half
      turned in her seat and Hortense&rsquo;s glance following her slight movement;
      the two then rose, as the General came down the walk with two chairs and
      Mrs. Gregory and Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael. Juno, with a bow to them,
      approached Hortense by a step or two, a brief touch of their fingers was
      to be seen, and Juno&rsquo;s departure took place, attended by the heavy
      hovering of General Rieppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why!&rdquo; I said to myself aloud, suddenly, at my open window.
      Immediately, however, I added, &ldquo;but can it be?&rdquo; And in my mind a whole
      little edifice of reasons for Hortense&rsquo;s apparent determination to marry
      John instantly fabricated itself&mdash;and then fell down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through John she was triumphantly bringing stiff Kings Port to her, was
      forcing them to accept her. But this was scarce enough temptation for
      Hortense to marry; she could do very well without Kings Port&mdash;indeed,
      she was not very likely to show herself in it, save to remind them, now
      and then, that she was there, and that they could not keep her out any
      more; this might amuse her a little, but the society itself would not
      amuse her in the least. What place had it for her to smoke her cigarettes
      in?
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza La Heu, then? Spite? The pleasure of taking something that somebody
      else wanted? The pleasure of spoiling somebody else&rsquo;s pleasure? Or, more
      accurately, the pleasure of power? Well, yes; that might be it, if
      Hortense Rieppe were younger in years, and younger, especially, in soul;
      but her museum was too richly furnished with specimens of the chase, she
      had collected too many bits and bibelots from life&rsquo;s Hotel Druot and the
      great bazaar of female competition, to pay so great a price as marriage
      for merely John; particularly when a lady, even in Newport, can have but
      one husband at a time in her collection. If she did actually love John, as
      Beverly Rodgers had reluctantly come to believe, it was most inappropriate
      in her! Had I followed out the train of reasoning which lay coiled up
      inside the word inappropriate, I might have reached the solution which
      eventually Hortense herself gave me, and the jewelled recesses of her
      nature would have blazed still more brilliantly to my eyes to-day; but in
      truth, my soul wasn&rsquo;t old enough yet to work Hortense out by itself,
      unaided!
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs. Gregory and Mrs. Weguelin sat on their chairs, and Hortense sat
      on her bench, tea was brought and a table laid, behind whose whiteness and
      silver Hortense began slight offices with cups and sugar tongs. She looked
      inquiry at her visitors, in answer to which Mrs. Gregory indicated
      acceptance, and Mrs. Weguelin refusal. The beauty of Hortense&rsquo;s face had
      strangely increased since the arrival of these two visitors. It shone
      resplendent behind the silver and the white cloth, and her movement, as
      she gave the cup to Mrs. Gregory St. Michael, was one of complete grace
      and admirable propriety. But once she looked away from them in the
      direction of the path. Her two visitors rose and left her, Mrs. Gregory
      setting her tea-cup down with a gesture that said she would take no more,
      and, after their bows of farewell, Hortense sat alone again pulling about
      the tea things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that by the table lay a card-case on the ground, evidently dropped
      by Mrs. Gregory; but Hortense could not see it where she sat. Her quick
      look along the path heralded more company and the General with more
      chairs. Young people now began to appear, the various motions of whom were
      more animated than the approaches and greetings and farewells of their
      elders; chairs were moved and exchanged, the General was useful in
      handling cups, and a number of faces unknown to me came and went, some of
      them elderly ones whom I had seen in church, or passed while walking; the
      black dresses of age mingled with the brighter colors of youth; and on her
      bench behind the cups sat Hortense, or rose up at right moments, radiant,
      restrained and adequate, receiving with deferential attention the remarks
      of some dark-clothed elder, or, with sufficiently interested countenance,
      inquiring something from a brighter one of her own generation; but twice I
      saw her look up the garden path. None of them stayed long, although when
      they were all gone the shadow of the garden wall had come as far as the
      arbor; and once again Hortense sat alone behind the table, leaning back
      with arms folded, and looking straight in front of her. At last she
      stirred, and rose slowly, and then, with a movement which was the
      perfection of timidity, began to advance, as John, with his Aunt Eliza,
      came along the path. To John, Hortense with familiar yet discreet
      brightness gave a left hand, as she waited for the old lady; and then the
      old lady went through with it. What that embrace of acknowledgment cost
      her cannot be measured, and during its process John stood like a sentinel.
      Possibly this was the price of his forgiveness to his Aunt Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors accepted tea, and the beauty in Hortense&rsquo;s face was now
      supreme. The old lady sat, forgetting to drink her tea, but very still in
      outward attitude, as she talked with Hortense; and the sight of one hand
      in its glove lying motionless upon her best dress, suddenly almost drew
      unexpected tears to my eyes. John was nearly as quiet as she, but the
      glove that he held was twisted between his fingers. I expected that he
      would stay with his Hortense when his aunt took her leave; he, however,
      was evidently expected by the old lady to accompany her out and back, I
      suppose, to her house, as was proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John&rsquo;s departure from Hortense differed from his meeting her. She gave
      no left hand to him now; she gazed at him, and then, as the old lady began
      to go toward the house, she moved a step toward him, and then she cast
      herself into his arms! It was no acting, this, no skilful simulation; her
      head sank upon his shoulder, and true passion spoke in every line of that
      beautiful surrendered form, as it leaned against her lover&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo; I exclaimed, once more aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a moment; and John, released, followed Miss Eliza. The old lady
      walked slowly, with that half-failing step that betokens the body&rsquo;s
      weariness after great mental or moral strain. Indeed, as John regained her
      side, she put her arm in his as if her feebleness needed his support. Thus
      they went away together, the aunt and her beloved boy, who had so sorely
      grieved and disappointed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this sight touched me, this glimpse of the vanquished leaving the
      field after supreme acknowledgment of defeat, upon Hortense it wrought
      another effect altogether. She stood looking after them, and as she
      looked, the whole woman from head to foot, motionless as she was, seemed
      to harden. Yet still she looked, until at length, slowly turning, her eyes
      chanced to fall upon Mrs. Gregory St. Michael&rsquo;s card-case. There it lay,
      the symbol of Kings Port&rsquo;s capitulation. She swooped down and up with a
      flying curve of grace, holding her prey caught; and then, catching also
      her handsome skirts on either side, she danced like a whirling fan among
      the empty chairs.

    <h2>
      XVIII: Again the Replacers
    </h2>
    <p>
      But a little while, and all that I had just witnessed in such vivid
      dumb-show might have seemed to me in truth some masque; so smooth had it
      been, and voiceless, coming and going like a devised fancy. And after the
      last of the players was gone from the stage, leaving the white cloth, and
      the silver, and the cups, and the groups of chairs near the pleasant
      arbor, I watched the deserted garden whence the sunlight was slowly
      departing, and it seemed to me more than ever like some empty and charming
      scene in a playhouse, to which the comedians would in due time return to
      repeat their delicate pantomime. But these were mental indulgences, with
      which I sat playing until the sight of my interrupted letter to Aunt
      Carola on the table before me brought the reality of everything back into
      my thoughts; and I shook my head over Miss Eliza. I remembered that hand
      of hers, lying in despondent acquiescence upon her lap, as the old lady
      sat in her best dress, formally and faithfully accepting the woman whom
      her nephew John had brought upon them as his bride-elect&mdash;formally
      and faithfully accepting this distasteful person, and thus atoning as best
      she could to her beloved nephew for the wrong that her affection had led
      her to do him in that ill-starred and inexcusable tampering with his
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was my letter waiting. I took my pen, and finished what I had to
      say about the negro and the injustice we had done to him, as well as to
      our own race, by the Fifteenth Amendment. I wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Northerners must often seem to these people strangely obtuse in
      their attitude. And they deserve such opinion, since all they need to do
      is come here and see for themselves what the War did to the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have a perfectly just fight with a man and beat him rightly; but
      if you are able to go on with your work next day, while his health is so
      damaged that for a long while he limps about as a cripple, you must not
      look up from your busy thriving and reproach him with his helplessness,
      and remind him of its cause; nor must you be surprised that he remembers
      the fight longer than you have time for. I know that the North meant to be
      magnanimous, that the North was magnanimous, that the spirit of Grant at
      Appomattox filled many breasts; and I know that the magnanimity was not
      met by those who led the South after Lee&rsquo;s retirement, and before
      reconstruction set in, and that the Fifteenth Amendment was brought on by
      their own doings: when have two wrongs made a right? And to place the
      negro above these people was an atrocity. You cannot expect them to
      inquire very industriously how magnanimous this North meant to be, when
      they have suffered at her hands worse, far worse, than France suffered
      from Germany&rsquo;s after 1870.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think there should be a different spirit among some of the
      later-born, but I have come to understand even the slights and suspicions
      from which I here and there suffer, since to their minds, shut in by
      circumstance, I&rsquo;m always a &lsquo;Yankee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are prosperous; and prosperity does not bind, it merely assembles
      people&mdash;at dinners and dances. It is adversity that binds&mdash;beside
      the gravestone, beneath the desolated roof. Could you come here and see
      what I have seen, the retrospect of suffering, the long, lingering
      convalescence, the small outlook of vigor to come, and the steadfast
      sodality of affliction and affection and fortitude, your kind but
      unenlightened heart would be wrung, as mine has been, and is being, at
      every turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After I had posted this reply to Aunt Carola, I had some fears that my pen
      had run away with me, and that she might now descend upon me with that
      reproof which she knew so well how to exercise in cases of disrespect. But
      there was actually a certain pathos in her mildness when it came. She felt
      it her duty to go over a good deal of history first, but:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand the present generation,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;and I suppose
      that I was not meant to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little sigh in these words did great credit to Aunt Carola.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vindication off my mind, and relieved by it of the more general
      thoughts about Kings Port and the South, which the pantomime of Kings
      Port&rsquo;s forced capitulation to Hortense had raised in me, I returned to the
      personal matters between that young woman and John, and Charley. How much
      did Charley know? How much would Charley stand? How much would John stand,
      if he came to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the scene in the garden now helped me to answer these questions much
      better than I could have answered them before its occurrence. With one
      fact&mdash;the great fact of love&mdash;established, it was not difficult
      to account for at least one or two of the several things that puzzled me.
      There could be no doubt that Hortense loved John Mayrant, loved him beyond
      her own control. When this love had begun, made no matter. Perhaps it
      began on the bridge, when the money was torn, and Eliza La Heu had
      appeared. The Kings Port version of Hortense&rsquo;s indifference to John before
      the event of the phosphates might well enough be true. It might even well
      enough be true that she had taken him and his phosphates at Newport for
      lack of anything better at hand, and because she was sick of disappointed
      hopes. In this case, Charley&rsquo;s subsequent appearance as something very
      much better (if the phosphates were to fail) would perfectly explain the
      various postponements of the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was able to answer my questions to myself thus: How much did Charley
      know?&mdash;Just what he could see for himself, and what he had most
      likely heard from Newport gossip. He could have heard of an old
      engagement, made purely for money&rsquo;s sake, and of recent delays created by
      the lady; and he could see the gentleman&mdash;an impossible husband from
      a Wall Street standpoint!&mdash;to whom Hortense was evidently tempering
      her final refusal by indulgently taking an interest in helping along his
      phosphate fortune. Charley would not refuse to lend her his aid in this
      estimable benevolence; nor would it occur to Charley&rsquo;s sensibilities how
      such benevolence would be taken by John if John were not &ldquo;taken&rdquo; himself.
      Yes, Charley was plainly fooled, and fooled the more readily because he
      had the old version of the truth. How should he suspect there was a
      revised version? How should he discover that passion had now changed
      sides, that it was now John who allowed himself to be loved? The signs of
      this did not occur before his eyes. Of course, Charley would not stay
      fooled forever; the hours of that were numbered,&mdash;but their number
      was quite beyond my guessing!
    </p>
    <p>
      How much would Charley stand? He would stand a good deal, because the
      measure of his toleration was the measure of his desire for Hortense; and
      it was plain that he wanted her very much indeed. But how much would John
      stand? How soon would his &ldquo;fire-eating&rdquo; traditions produce a &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;?
      Why had they not done this already? Well, the garden had in some way
      helped me to frame a fairly reasonable answer for this also. Poor Hortense
      had become as powerless to woo John to warmth as poor Venus had been with
      Adonis; and passion, in changing sides, had advanced the boy&rsquo;s knowledge.
      He knew now the difference between the embraces of his lady when she had
      merely wanted his phosphates, and these other caresses now that, she
      wanted him. In his ceaseless search for some possible loophole of escape,
      his eye could not have overlooked the chance that lay in Charley, and he
      was far too canny to blast his forlorn hope. He had probably wondered what
      had changed the nature of Hortense&rsquo;s caresses, and the adventure of the
      torn money could scarce have failed to suggest itself to the mind of a
      youth who, little as he had trodden the ways of the world, evidently
      possessed some lively instincts regarding the nature of women. To batter
      Charley as he had battered Juno&rsquo;s nephew, might result in winding the arms
      of Hortense around his own neck more tightly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why Hortense should keep Charley &ldquo;on&rdquo; any longer, was what I could least
      fathom, but I trusted her to have excellent reasons for anything that she
      did. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure to be quite simple, once you know it,&rdquo; I told myself; and
      the near future proved me to be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I laid most of my enigmas to rest; there was but one which now and
      then awakened still. Were Hortense a raw girl of eighteen, I could easily
      grant that the &ldquo;fire-eater&rdquo; in John would be sure to move her. But
      Hortense had travelled many miles away from the green forests of romance;
      her present fields were carpeted, not with grass and flowers, but with
      Oriental mats and rugs, and it was electric lights, not the moon and
      stars, that shone upon her highly seasoned nights. No, torn money and all,
      it was not appropriate in a woman of her experience; and so I still found
      myself inquiring in the words of Beverly Rodgers, &ldquo;But what can she want
      him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time that I met Mrs. Gregory St. Michael it was on my way to join
      the party at the old church, which Mrs. Weguelin was going to show them.
      The card-case was in her hand, and the sight of it prompted me to allude
      to Hortense Rieppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find her beauty growing upon me?&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gregory did not deny the beauty, although she spoke with reserve at
      first. &ldquo;It is to be said that she knows how to write a suitable note,&rdquo; the
      lady also admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t tell me what the note was about, naturally; but I could imagine
      with what joy in the exercise of her art Hortense had constructed that
      communication which must have accompanied the prompt return of the
      card-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Gregory&rsquo;s tongue became downright. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re able to see so
      much of her, why don&rsquo;t you tell her to marry that little steam-yacht
      gambler? I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s dying to, and he&rsquo;s just the thing for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;Love so seldom knows what&rsquo;s just the thing for
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your precocity theory falls,&rdquo; declared Mrs. St. Michael. And as she
      went away from me along the street, I watched her beautiful stately walk;
      for who could help watching a sight so good?
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley, then, was no secret to John&rsquo;s people. Was John still a secret to
      Charley? Could Hortense possibly have managed this? I hoped for a chance
      to observe the two men with her during the visit of Mrs. Weguelin St.
      Michael and her party to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      This party was already assembled when I arrived upon the spot appointed.
      In the street, a few paces from the church, stood Bohm and Charley and
      Kitty and Gazza, with Beverly Rodgers, who, as I came near, left them and
      joined me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s somewhere off with her fire-eater,&rdquo; responded Beverly to my
      immediate inquiry for Hortense. &ldquo;Do you think she was asked, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Probably not, I thought. &ldquo;But she goes so well with the rest,&rdquo; I
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly gave his chuckle. &ldquo;She goes where she likes. She&rsquo;ll meet us here
      when we&rsquo;re finished, I&rsquo;m pretty sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why such certainty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she has to attend to Charley, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weguelin, it appeared, had met the party here by the church, but had
      now gone somewhere in the immediate neighborhood to find out why the gate
      was not opened to admit us, and to hasten the unpunctual custodian of the
      keys. I had not looked for precisely such a party as Mrs. Weguelin&rsquo;s
      invitation had gathered, nor could I imagine that she had fully understood
      herself what she was gathering; and this I intimated to Beverly Rodgers,
      saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose, my friend, that she suspected the feather of the birds
      you flock with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beverly took it lightly. &ldquo;Hang it, old boy, of course everybody can&rsquo;t be
      as nice as I am!&rdquo; But he took it less lightly before it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood chatting apart, he and I, while Bohm and Charley and Kitty and
      Gazza walked across the street to the window of a shop, where old
      furniture was for sale at a high price; and it grew clearer to me what
      Beverly had innocently brought upon Mrs. Weguelin, and how he had brought
      it. The little quiet, particular lady had been pleased with his visit, and
      pleased with him. His good manners, his good appearance, his good
      English-trained voice, all these things must have been extremely to her
      taste; and then&mdash;more important than they&mdash;did she not know
      about his people? She had inquired, he told me, with interest about two of
      his uncles, whom she had last seen in 1858. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s awfully the right
      sort,&rdquo; said Beverly. Yes, I saw well how that visit must have gone: the
      gentle old lady reviving in Beverly&rsquo;s presence, and for the sake of being
      civil to him, some memories of her girlhood, some meetings with those
      uncles, some dances with them; and generally shedding from her talk and
      manner the charm of some sweet old melody&mdash;and Beverly, the facile,
      the appreciative, sitting there with her at a correct, deferential angle
      on his chair, admirably sympathetic and in good form, and playing the old
      school. (He had no thought to deceive her; the old school was his by
      right, and genuinely in his blood, he took to it like a duck to the
      water.) How should Mrs. Weguelin divine that he also took to the nouveau
      jeu to the tune of Bohm and Charley and Kitty and Gazza? And so, to show
      him some attention, and because she couldn&rsquo;t ask him to a meal, why, she
      would take him over the old church, her colonial forefathers&rsquo;; she would
      tell him the little legends about them; he was precisely the young man to
      appreciate such things&mdash;and she would be pleased if he would also
      bring the friends with whom he was travelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked across the street at Bohm and Charley and Kitty and Gazza. They
      were now staring about them in all their perfection of stare: small
      Charley in a sleek slate-colored suit, as neat as any little barber; Bohm,
      massive, portentous, his strong shoes and gloves the chief note in his
      dress, and about his whole firm frame a heavy mechanical strength, a look
      as of something that did something rapidly and accurately when set going&mdash;cut
      or cracked or ground or smashed something better and faster than it had
      ever been cut or cracked or ground or smashed before, and would take your
      arms and legs off if you didn&rsquo;t stand well back from it; it was only in
      Bohm&rsquo;s eye and lips that you saw he wasn&rsquo;t made entirely of brass and
      iron, that champagne and shoulders decolletes received a punctual share of
      his valuable time. And there was Kitty, too, just the wife for Bohm, so
      soon as she could divorce her husband, to whom she had united herself
      before discovering that all she married him for, his old Knickerbocker
      name, was no longer in the slightest degree necessary for social
      acceptance; while she could feed people, her trough would be well
      thronged. Kitty was neat, Kitty was trig, Kitty was what Beverly would
      call &ldquo;swagger &ldquo;; her skilful tailor-made clothes sheathed her closely and
      gave her the excellent appearance of a well-folded English umbrella; it
      was in her hat that she had gone wrong&mdash;a beautiful hat in itself,
      one which would have wholly become Hortense; but for poor Kitty it didn&rsquo;t
      do at all. Yes, she was a well folded English umbrella, only the umbrella
      had for its handle the head of a bulldog or the leg of a ballet-dancer.
      And these were the Replacers whom Beverly&rsquo;s clear-sighted eyes saw
      swarming round the temple of his civilization, pushing down the aisles,
      climbing over the backs of the benches, walking over each other&rsquo;s bodies,
      and seizing those front seats which his family had sat in since New York
      had been New York; and so the wise fellow very prudently took every step
      that would insure the Replacers&rsquo; inviting him to occupy one of his own
      chairs. I had almost forgotten little Gazza, the Italian nobleman, who
      sold old furniture to new Americans. Gazza was not looking at the old
      furniture of Kings Port, which must have filled his Vatican soul with
      contempt; he was strolling back and forth in the street, with his head in
      the air, humming, now loudly, now softly &ldquo;La-la, la-la, E quando a la
      predica in chiesa siederia, la-la-la-la;&rdquo; and I thought to myself that,
      were I the Pope, I should kick him into the Tiber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael came back with the keys and their
      custodian, Bohm was listening to the slow, clear words of Charley, in
      which he evidently found something that at length interested him&mdash;a
      little. Bohm, it seemed, did not often speak himself: possibly once a
      week. His way was to let other people speak to him when there were signs
      in his face that he was hearing anything which they said, it was a high
      compliment to them, and of course Charley could command Bohm&rsquo;s ear; for
      Charley, although he was as neat as any barber, and let Hortense walk on
      him because he looked beyond that, and purposed to get her, was just as
      potent in the financial world as Bohm, could bring a borrowing empire to
      his own terms just as skillfully as could Bohm; was, in short, a man after
      Bohm&rsquo;s own&mdash;I had almost said heart: the expression is so obstinately
      embedded in our language! Bohm, listening, and Charley, talking, had
      neither of them noticed Mrs. Weguelin&rsquo;s arrival; they stood ignoring her,
      while she waited, casting a timid eye upon them. But Beverly, suddenly
      perceiving this, and begging her pardon for them, brought the party
      together, and we moved in among the old graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Gazza, bending to read the quaint words cut upon one of them,
      as we stopped while the door at the rear of the church was being opened,
      &ldquo;French!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the mother-tongue of these colonists,&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin explained to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! like Canada!&rdquo; cried Gazza. &ldquo;But what a pretty bit is that!&rdquo; And he
      stood back to admire a little glimpse, across a street, between tiled
      roofs and rusty balconies, of another church steeple. &ldquo;Almost, one would
      say, the Old World,&rdquo; Gazza declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our world is not new,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weguelin; and she passed into the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kings Port holds many sacred nooks, many corners, many vistas, that should
      deeply stir the spirit and the heart of all Americans who know and love
      their country. The passing traveller may gaze up at certain windows there,
      and see History herself looking out at him, even as she looks out of the
      windows of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. There are also other ancient
      buildings in Kings Port, where History is shut up, as in a strong-box,&mdash;such
      as that stubborn old octagon, the powder-magazine of Revolutionary times,
      which is a chest holding proud memories of blood and war. And then there
      are the three churches. Not strong-boxes, these, but shrines, where burn
      the venerable lamps of faith. And of these three houses of God, that one
      holds the most precious flame, the purest light, which treasures the holy
      fire that came from France. The English colonists, who sat in the other
      two congregations, came to Carolina&rsquo;s soil to better their estate; but it
      was for liberty of soul, to lift their ardent and exalted prayer to God as
      their own conscience bade them, and not as any man dictated, that those
      French colonists sought the New World. No Puritan splendor of independence
      and indomitable courage outshines theirs. They preached a word as burning
      as any that Plymouth or Salem ever heard. They were but a handful, yet so
      fecund was their marvelous zeal that they became the spiritual leaven of
      their whole community. They are less known than Plymouth and Salem,
      because men of action, rather than men of letters, have sprung from the
      loins of the South; but there they stand, a beautiful beacon, shining upon
      the coasts of our early history. Into their church, then, into the shrine
      where their small lamp still burns, their devout descendant, Mrs. Weguelin
      St. Michael led our party, because in her eyes Kings Port could show
      nothing more precious and significant. There had been nothing to warn her
      that Bohm and Charley were Americans who neither knew nor loved their
      country, but merely Americans who knew their country&rsquo;s wealth and loved to
      acquire every penny of it that they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, following the steps of our delicate and courteous guide, we
      entered into the dimness of the little building; and Mrs. Weguelin&rsquo;s
      voice, lowered to suit the sanctity which the place had for her, began to
      tell us very quietly and clearly the story of its early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew it, or something of it, from books; but from this little lady&rsquo;s
      lips it took on a charm and graciousness which made it fresh to me. I
      listened attentively, until I felt, without at first seeing the cause,
      that dulling of enjoyment, that interference with the receptive attention,
      which comes at times to one during the performance of music when untimely
      people come in or go out. Next, I knew that our group of listeners was
      less compact; and then, as we moved from the first point in the church to
      a new one, I saw that Bohm and Charley were dropping behind, and I
      lingered, with the intention of bringing them closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was nothing in it,&rdquo; I heard Charley&rsquo;s slow monologue continuing
      behind me to the silent Bohm. &ldquo;We could have bought the Parsons road at
      that time. &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; I said to them, &lsquo;what is there for us in
      tide-water at Kings Port? &lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be done, and I rejoined Mrs. Weguelin and those of the party
      who were making some show of attention to her quiet little histories and
      explanations; and Kitty&rsquo;s was the next voice which I heard ring out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must never let it fall to pieces! It&rsquo;s the cunningest little
      fossil I&rsquo;ve seen in the South.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Charley behind me, &ldquo;we let the other crowd buy their strategic
      point; and I guess they know they got a gold brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I moved away from the financiers, I endeavored not to hear their words;
      and in this much I was successful; but their inappropriate presence had
      got, I suppose upon my nerves; at any rate, go where I would in the little
      church, or attend as I might and did to what Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael
      said about the tablets, and whatever traditions their inscriptions
      suggested to her, that quiet, low, persistent banker&rsquo;s voice of Charley&rsquo;s
      pervaded the building like a draft of cold air. Once, indeed, he addressed
      Mrs. Weguelin a question. She was telling Beverly (who followed her
      throughout, protectingly and charmingly, with his most devoted attention
      and his best manner) the honorable deeds of certain older generations of a
      family belonging to this congregation, some of whose tombs outside had
      borne French inscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weguelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nowadays,&rdquo; inquired Beverly, &ldquo;what do they find instead of military
      careers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no more of us nowadays; they&mdash;they were killed in the
      war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And immediately she smiled, and with her hand she made a light gesture, as
      if to dismiss this subject from mutual embarrassment and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known better,&rdquo; murmured the understanding Beverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Charley now had his question. &ldquo;How many, did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Mrs. Weguelin did not quite understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were killed?&rdquo; explained Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a little pause before Mrs. Weguelin answered, &ldquo;My four
      brothers met their deaths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley was interested. &ldquo;And what was the percentage of fatality in their
      regiments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weguelin, &ldquo;we did not think of it in that way.&rdquo; And she
      turned aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley,&rdquo; said Kitty, with some precipitancy, &ldquo;do make Mr. Bohm look at
      the church!&rdquo; and she turned after Mrs. Weguelin. &ldquo;It is such a gem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I saw the little lady try to speak and fail, and then I noticed that
      she was leaning against a window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly Rodgers also noticed this, and he hastened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she returned to his hasty question, &ldquo;I am quite well. If you
      are not tired of it, shall we go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is such a gem!&rdquo; repeated Kitty, throwing an angry glance at Charley
      and Bohm. And so we went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Kitty did her best to cover it up; Kitty, as she would undoubtedly
      have said herself, could see a few things. But nobody could cover it up,
      though Beverly was now vigilant in his efforts to do so. Indeed, Replacers
      cannot be covered up by human agency; they bulge, they loom, they stare,
      they dominate the road of life, even as their automobiles drive horses and
      pedestrians to the wall. Bohm, roused from his financial torpor by Kitty&rsquo;s
      sharp command, did actually turn his eyes upon the church, which he had
      now been inside for some twenty minutes without noticing. Instinct and
      long training had given his eye, when it really looked at anything, a
      particular glance&mdash;the glance of the Replacer&mdash;which plainly
      calculated: &ldquo;Can this be made worth money to me?&rdquo; and which died instantly
      to a glaze of indifference on seeing that no money could be made. Bohm&rsquo;s
      eye, accordingly, waked and then glazed. Manners, courtesy, he did not
      need, not yet; he had looked at them with his Replacer glance, and, seeing
      no money in them, had gone on looking at railroads, and mines, and mills,&mdash;and
      bare shoulders, and bottles. Should manners and courtesy come, some day,
      to mean money to him, then he could have them, in his fashion, so that his
      admirers and his apologists should alike declare of him, &ldquo;A rough diamond,
      but consider what he has made of himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After what, did you say?&rdquo; This was the voice of Gazza, addressing Mrs.
      Weguelin St. Michael. It must be said of Gazza that he, too, made a
      certain presence of interest in the traditions of Kings Port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weguelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Built it in Savannah,&rdquo; Charley was saying to Bohm, &ldquo;or Norfolk. This is a
      good place to bury people in, but not money. Now the phosphate proposition&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I dragged my attention by force away from that quiet, relentless
      monologue, and listened as well as I could to Mrs. Weguelin. There had
      come to be among us all, I think&mdash;Beverly, Kitty, Gazza, and myself&mdash;a
      joint impulse to shield her, to cluster about her, to follow her steps
      from each little lecture that she finished to the new point where the next
      lecture began; and we did it, performed our pilgrimage to the end; but
      there was less and less nature in our performance. I knew (and it was like
      a dream which I could not stop) that we pressed a little too close, that
      our questions were a little too eager, that we overprinted our faces with
      attention; knowing this did not help, nothing helped, and we went on to
      the end, seeing ourselves doing it; and it must have been that Mrs.
      Weguelin saw us likewise. But she was truly admirable in giving no sign,
      she came out well ahead; the lectures were not hurried, one had no sense
      of points being skipped to accommodate our unworthiness, it required a
      previous familiarity with the church to know (as I did) that there was,
      indeed, more and more skipping; yet the little lady played her part so
      evenly and with never a falter of voice nor a change in the gentle
      courtesy of her manner, that I do not think&mdash;save for that moment at
      the window-sill&mdash;I could have been sure what she thought, or how much
      she noticed. Her face was always so pale, it may well have been all
      imagination with me that she seemed, when we emerged at last into the
      light of the street, paler than usual; but I am almost certain that her
      hand was trembling as she stood receiving the thanks of the party. These
      thanks were cut a little short by the arrival of one of the automobiles,
      and, at the same time, the appearance of Hortense strolling toward us with
      John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley had resumed to Bohm, &ldquo;A tax of twenty-five cents on the ton is
      nothing with deposits of this richness,&rdquo; when his voice ceased; and
      looking at him to see the cause, I perceived that his eye was on John, and
      that his polished finger-nail was running meditatively along his thin
      mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hortense took the matter&mdash;whatever the matter was&mdash;in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t much time,&rdquo; she said to Charles, who consulted his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming to see me off?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo; I asked Beverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sending him North,&rdquo; Beverly answered, and then he spoke with his
      very best simple manner to Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael. &ldquo;May I not walk home
      with you after all your kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was going to say no, for she had had enough of this party; but she
      looked at Beverly, and his face and his true solicitude won her; she said,
      &ldquo;Thank you, if you will.&rdquo; And the two departed together down the shabby
      street, the little veiled lady in black, and Beverly with his excellent
      London clothes and his still more excellent look of respectful, sheltering
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Bohm pronounced the only utterance that I heard fall from his lips
      during his stay in Kings Port. He looked at the church he had come from,
      he looked at the neighboring larger church whose columns stood out at the
      angle of the street; he looked at the graveyard opposite that, then at the
      stale, dusty shop of old furniture, and then up the shabby street, where
      no life or movement was to be seen, except the distant forms of Beverly
      and Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael. Then from a gold cigar-case, curved to fit
      his breast pocket, he took a cigar and lighted it from a gold match-box.
      Offering none of us a cigar, he placed the case again in his pocket; and
      holding his lighted cigar a moment with two fingers in his strong glove,
      he spoke:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This town&rsquo;s worse than Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he got into the automobile. They all followed to see Charley off, and
      he addressed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you will make one of a little party on the
      yacht next Sunday, when I come back. And you also,&rdquo; he added to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both John and I expressed our acceptance in suitable forms, and the
      automobile took its way to the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Kings Port streets,&rdquo; I said, as we walked back toward Mrs.
      Trevise&rsquo;s, &ldquo;are not very favorable for automobiles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he returned briefly. I don&rsquo;t remember that either of us found more
      to say until we had reached my front door, when he asked, &ldquo;Will the day
      after to-morrow suit you for Udolpho?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you say,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weather permitting, of course. But I hope that it will; for after that I
      suppose my time will not be quite so free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After we had parted it struck me that this was the first reference to his
      approaching marriage that John had ever made in my hearing since that day
      long ago (it seemed long ago, at least) when he had come to the Exchange
      to order the wedding-cake, and Eliza La Heu had fallen in love with him at
      sight. That, in my opinion, looking back now with eyes at any rate
      partially opened, was what Eliza had done. Had John returned the
      compliment then, or since?

    <h2>
      XIX: Udolpho
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was to me continuously a matter of satisfaction and of interest to see
      Hortense disturbed&mdash;whether for causes real or imaginary&mdash;about
      the security of her title to her lover John, nor can I say that my
      misinterpreted bunch of roses diminished this satisfaction. I should have
      been glad to know if the accomplished young woman had further probed that
      question and discovered the truth, but it seemed scarce likely that she
      could do this without the help of one of three persons, Eliza and myself
      who knew all, or John who knew nothing; for the up-country bride, and
      whatever other people in Kings Port there were to whom the bride might
      gayly recite the tale of my roses, were none of them likely to encounter
      Miss Rieppe; their paths and hers would not meet until they met in church
      at the wedding of Hortense and John. No, she could not have found out the
      truth; for never in the world would she, at this eleventh hour, risk a
      conversation with John upon a subject so full of well-packed explosives;
      and so she must be simply keeping on both him and Eliza an eye as watchful
      as lay in her power. As for Charley, what bait, what persuasion, what
      duress she had been able to find that took him at an hour so critical from
      her side to New York, I could not in the least conjecture. Had she said to
      the little banker, Go, because I must think it over alone? It did not seem
      strong enough. Or had she said, Go, and on your return you shall have my
      answer? Not adequate either, I thought. Or had it been, If you don&rsquo;t go,
      it shall be &ldquo;no,&rdquo; to-day and forever? This last was better; but there was
      no telling, nor did Beverly Rodgers, to whom I propounded all my theories,
      have any notion of what was between Hortense and Charley. He only knew
      that Charley was quite aware of the existence of John, but had always been
      merely amused at the notion of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have you been merely amused,&rdquo; I reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since that look I saw her give him, old chap. I know she wants him,
      only not why she wants him. And Charley, you know&mdash;well, of course,
      poor Charley&rsquo;s a banker, just a banker and no more; and a banker is merely
      the ace in the same pack where the drummer is the two-spot. Our American
      civilization should be called Drummer&rsquo;s Delight&mdash;and there&rsquo;s nothing
      in your fire-eater to delight a drummer: he&rsquo;s a gentleman, he&rsquo;ll be only
      so-so rich, and he&rsquo;s away back out of the lime-light, while poor old
      Charley&rsquo;s a bounder, and worth forty millions anyhow, and right in the
      centre of the glare. How should he see any danger in John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he hasn&rsquo;t begun to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps. He and Hortense have been &lsquo;talking business&rsquo;; I know that.
      Oh&mdash;and why do you think she said he must go to New York? To make a
      better deal for the fire-eater&rsquo;s phosphates than his fuddling old trustee
      here was going to close with. Charley said that could be arranged by
      telegram. But she made him go himself! She&rsquo;s extraordinary. He&rsquo;ll arrive
      in town to-morrow, he&rsquo;ll leave next day, he&rsquo;ll reach here by the Southern
      on Saturday night in time for our Sunday yacht picnic, and then something
      has got to happen, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was another key, unlocking a further piece of knowledge for me. I had
      not been able to guess why Hortense should be keeping Charley &ldquo;on&rdquo;; but
      how natural was this policy, when understood clearly! She still needed
      Charley&rsquo;s influence in the world of affairs. Charley&rsquo;s final service was
      to be the increasing of his successful rival&rsquo;s fortune. I wondered what
      Charley would do, when the full extent of his usefulness dawned upon him;
      and with wonder renewed I thought of General Rieppe, and this daughter he
      had managed to beget. Surely the mother of Hortense, whoever she may have
      been, must have been a very richly endowed character!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has most certainly got to happen and soon,&rdquo; I said to Beverly
      Rodgers. &ldquo;Especially if my busy boarding-house bodies are right in saying
      that the invitations for the wedding are to be out on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, I had Friday, I had Udolpho; and there, while on that excursion,
      when I should be alone with John Mayrant during many hours, and especially
      the hours of deep, confidential night, I swore to myself on oath I would
      say to the boy the last word, up to the verge of offense, that my wits
      could devise. Apart from a certain dramatic excitement as of battle&mdash;battle
      between Hortense and me&mdash;I truly wished to help him out of the
      miserable mistake his wrong standard, his chivalry gone perverted, was
      spurring him on to make; and I had a comic image of myself, summoning Miss
      Josephine, summoning Miss Eliza, summoning Mrs. Gregory and Mrs. Weguelin,
      and the whole company of aunts and cousins, and handing to them the
      rescued John with the single but sufficient syllable: &ldquo;There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in apparent spirits, was John, at that hour of our departure for
      Udolpho; he pretended so well that I was for a while altogether deceived.
      He had wished to call for me with the conveyance in which he should drive
      us out into the lonely country through the sunny afternoon; but instead, I
      chose to walk round to where he lived, and where I found him stuffing
      beneath the seats of the vehicle the baskets and the parcels which
      contained the provisions for our ample supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen you drink hearty yet, and now I purpose to,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the packing was finishing Miss Josephine St. Michael came by; and the
      sight of the erect old lady reminded me that of all Kings Port figures
      known to me and seen in the garden paying their visit of ceremony to
      Hortense, she alone&mdash;she and Eliza La Heu&mdash;had been absent.
      Eliza&rsquo;s declining to share in that was well-nigh inevitable, but Miss
      Josephine was another matter. Perhaps she had considered her sister&rsquo;s
      going there to be enough; at any rate, she had not been party to the
      surrender, and this gave me whimsical satisfaction. Moreover, it had
      evidently occasioned no ruffle in the affectionate relations between
      herself and John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as you drive by, do get me a plumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better get a burglar, Aunt Josephine. Cheaper in the end, and neater
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was thus, at the outset, that I came to believe John&rsquo;s spirits were
      high; and this illusion he successfully kept up until after we had left
      the plumber and Kings Port several sordid miles behind us; the approach to
      Kings Port this way lies through dirtiest Africa. John was loquacious;
      John discoursed upon the Replacers; Mrs. Weguelin St. Michael had quite
      evidently expressed to her own circle what she thought of them; and the
      town in consequence, although it did not see them or their automobiles,
      because it appeared they were gone some twenty miles inland upon an
      excursion to a resort where was a large hotel, and a little variety in the
      way of some tourists of the Replacer stripe,&mdash;the town kept them well
      in its mind&rsquo;s eye. The automobiles would have sufficed to bring them into
      disrepute, but Kings Port had a better reason in their conduct in the
      church; and John found many things to say to me, as we drove along, about
      Bohm and Charley and Kitty. Gazza he forgot, although, as shall appear in
      its place, Gazza was likely to live a long while in his memory. Beverly
      Rodgers he, of course, recognized as being a gentleman&mdash;it was clear
      that Beverly met with Kings Port&rsquo;s approval&mdash;and, from his Newport
      experiences, John was able to make out quite as well as if he had heard
      Beverly explain it himself the whole wise philosophic system of joining
      with the Replacers in order that you be not replaced yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his shoes mightn&rsquo;t I do the same?&rdquo; he surmised. &ldquo;I fear I&rsquo;m not as
      Spartan as my aunts&mdash;only pray don&rsquo;t mention it to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, because I had been answering him with single syllables, or with
      nods, or not at all, he taxed me with my taciturnity; he even went so far
      as to ask me what thoughts kept me so silent&mdash;which I did not tell
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wondering,&rdquo; I told him instead, &ldquo;how much they steal every week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those financiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Bohm is president of an insurance company, and Charley&rsquo;s a director,
      and reorganizes railroads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if other people share your pleasant opinion of them, how do they
      get elected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people share their pleasant spoils&mdash;senators, vestrymen&mdash;you
      can&rsquo;t be sure who you&rsquo;re sitting next to at dinner any more. Come live
      North. You&rsquo;ll find the only safe way is never to know anybody worth more
      than five millions&mdash;if you wish to keep the criminal classes off your
      visiting list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made him merry. &ldquo;Put &lsquo;em in jail, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the jail!&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the great American joke. It reverses the
      rule of our smart society. Only those who have no incomes are admitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you have laws and lawyers for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep the rich out of jail. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;professional etiquette.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your picture flatters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me; it&rsquo;s only a photograph. Come North and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might think, from your account, the American had rather be bad than
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear, no! The American had much rather be good than bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your admission amazes me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But also the American had rather be rich than good. And he is having his
      wish. And money&rsquo;s golden hand is tightening on the throat of liberty while
      the labor union stabs liberty in the back&mdash;for trusts and unions are
      both trying to kill liberty. And the soul of Uncle Sam has turned into a
      dollar-inside his great, big, strong, triumphant flesh; so that even his
      new religion, his own special invention, his last offering to the creeds
      of the world, his gatherer of converted hordes, his Christian Science, is
      based upon physical benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John touched the horses. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re particularly cheerful to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I merely summarize what I&rsquo;m seeing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a moral awakening will come,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inevitably. To-morrow, perhaps. The flesh has had a good, long,
      prosperous day, and the hour of the spirit must be near striking. And the
      moral awakening will be followed by a moral slumber, since, in the
      uncomprehended scheme of things, slumber seems necessary; and you needn&rsquo;t
      pull so long a face, Mr. Mayrant, because the slumber will be followed by
      another moral awakening. The alcoholic society girl you don&rsquo;t like will
      very probably give birth to a water-drinking daughter&mdash;who in her
      turn may produce a bibulous progeny: how often must I tell you that
      nothing is final?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Mayrant gave the horses a somewhat vicious lash after these last
      words of mine; and, as he made no retort to them, we journeyed some little
      distance in silence through the mild, enchanting light of the sun. My
      deliberate allusion to alcoholic girls had made plain what I had begun to
      suspect. I could now discern that his cloak of gayety had fallen from him,
      leaving bare the same harassed spirit, the same restless mood, which had
      been his upon the last occasion when we had talked at length together upon
      some of the present social and political phases of our republic&mdash;that
      day of the New Bridge and the advent of Hortense. Only, upon that day, he
      had by his manner in some subtle fashion conveyed to me a greater security
      in my discretion than I felt him now to entertain. His many observations
      about the Replacers, with always the significant and conspicuous omission
      of Hortense, proved more and more, as I thought it over, that his state
      was unsteady. Even now, he did not long endure silence between us; yet the
      eagerness which he threw into our discussions did not, it seemed to me, so
      much proceed from present interest in their subjects (though interest
      there was at times) as from anxiety lest one particular subject, ever
      present with him, should creep in unawares. So much I, at any rate,
      concluded, and bided my time for the creeping in unawares, content
      meanwhile to parry some of the reproaches which he now and again cast at
      me with an earnestness real or feigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had made now considerable progress, and were come to a space of sand
      and cabins and intersecting railroad tracks, where freight cars and
      locomotives stood, and negroes of all shapes, but of one lowering and
      ragged appearance, lounged and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There used to be a murder here about once a day,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;before the
      dispensary system. Now, it is about once a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That law is of benefit, then?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To those who drink the whiskey, possibly; certainly to those who sell
      it!&rdquo; And he condensed for me the long story of the state dispensary, which
      in brief appeared to be that South Carolina had gone into the liquor
      business. The profits were to pay for compulsory education; the liquor was
      to be pure; society and sobriety were to be advanced: such had been the
      threefold promise, of which the threefold fulfillment was&mdash;defeat of
      the compulsory education bill, a political monopoly enriching favored
      distillers, &ldquo;and lately,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;a thoroughly democratic whiskey for
      the plain people. Pay ten cents for a bottle of X, if you&rsquo;re curious. It
      may not poison you&mdash;but the murders are coming up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful example of government ownership!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John in Kings Port was not in the way of hearing that cure-all policy
      discussed, and I therefore explained it to him. He did not seem to grasp
      my explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it would change anything,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;beyond switching
      the stealing from one set of hands to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put on a face of concern. &ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t believe in our patent
      American short-cuts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short-cuts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Short-cuts to universal happiness, universal honesty,
      universal everything. For instance: Don&rsquo;t make a boy study four years for
      a college degree; just cut the time in half, and you&rsquo;ve got a short-cut to
      education. Write it down that man is equal. That settles it. You&rsquo;ll notice
      how equal he is at once. Write it down that the negro shall vote. You&rsquo;ll
      observe how instantly he is fit for the suffrage. Now they want it written
      down that government shall take all the wicked corporations, because then
      corruption will disappear from the face of the earth. You&rsquo;ll find the
      farmers presently having it written down that all hens must hatch their
      eggs in a week, and next, a league of earnest women will advocate a
      Constitutional amendment that men only shall bring forth children. Oh, we
      Americans are very thorough!&rdquo; And I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John&rsquo;s face was not gay. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;South Carolina took a
      short-cut to pure liquor and sober citizens&mdash;and reached instead a
      new den of thieves. Is the whole country sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick to the marrow, my friend; but young and vigorous still. A nation in
      its long life has many illnesses before the one it dies of. But we shall
      need some strong medicine if we do not get well soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s beyond any one! And we have several things the matter with us&mdash;as
      bad a case, for example, of complacency as I&rsquo;ve met in history.
      Complacency&rsquo;s a very dangerous disease, seldom got rid of without the
      purge of a great calamity. And worse, where does our dishonesty begin, and
      where end? The boy goes to college, and there in football it awaits him;
      he graduates, and in the down-town office it smirks at him; he rises into
      the confidence of his superiors, the town&rsquo;s chief citizens, and finds
      their gray hairs crowned with it,&mdash;the very men he has looked up to,
      believed in, his ideals, his examples, the merchant prince, the railroad
      magnate, the president of insurance companies&mdash;all dirty rascals!
      Presently he faces worldly success or failure, and then, in the new ocean
      of mind that has swallowed morals up, he sinks with his isolated honesty,
      like a fool, or swims to respectability with his brother knaves. And into
      this mess the immigrant sewage of Europe is steadily pouring. Such is our
      continent to-day, with all its fair winds and tides and fields favorable
      to us, and only our shallow, complacent, dishonest selves against us! But
      don&rsquo;t let these considerations make you gloomy; for (I must say it again)
      nothing is final; and even if we rot before we ripen&mdash;which would be
      a wholly novel phenomenon&mdash;we shall have made our contribution to
      mankind in demonstrating by our collapse that the sow&rsquo;s ear belongs with
      the rest of the animal, and not in the voting booth or the legislature,
      and that the doctrine of universal suffrage should have waited until men
      were born honest and equal. That in itself would be a memorable service to
      have rendered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had come into the divine, sad stillness of the woods, where the warm
      sunlight shone through the gray moss, lighting the curtained solitudes
      away and away into the depths of the golden afternoon; and somewhere amid
      the miles of sleeping wilderness sounded the hoarse honk of the
      automobile. The Replacers were abroad, enjoying what they could in this
      country where they did not belong, and which did not as yet belong to
      them. Once again we heard their honk off to our left, from a farther
      distance, and I am glad to say that we did not see them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said John Mayrant, &ldquo;what you have said is true, the nation had
      better get on its knees and pray God to give it grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the boy and saw that his countenance had grown very fine. &ldquo;The
      act,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;would bring grace, wherever it comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;If in the stars and awfulness of space there&rsquo;s
      nothing, that does not trouble me; for my greater self is inside me, safe.
      And our country has a greater self somewhere. Think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not have to think,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;when I know the nobleness we have
      risen to at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;happen to believe it is not all only stars and
      space; and that God, as much as any ship-builder, rejoices to watch every
      tiniest boat meet and brave the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of his troubles he had brought such mood, sweetness instead of
      bitterness; he was saying as plainly as if his actual words said it,
      &ldquo;Misfortune has come to me, and I am going to make the best of it.&rdquo; His
      nobleness, his moral elegance, compelled him to this, and I envied him,
      not sure if I myself, thus placed, would acquit myself so well. And there
      was in his sweetness a contagion that strangely reconciled me to the
      troubled aspects of our national hour. I thought, &ldquo;Invisible among our
      eighty millions there is a quiet legion living untainted in the depths,
      while the yellow rich, the prismatic scum and bubbles, boil on the
      surface.&rdquo; Yes, he had accidentally helped me, and I wished doubly that I
      might help him. It was well enough he should feel he must not shirk his
      duty, but how much better if he could be led to see that marrying where he
      did not love was no duty of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew what I had to say to him, but lacked the beginning of it; and of
      this beginning I was in search as we drove up among the live-oaks of
      Udolpho to the little club-house, or hunting lodge, where a negro and his
      wife received us, and took the baskets and set about preparing supper. My
      beginning sat so heavily upon my attention that I took scant notice of
      Udolpho as we walked about its adjacent grounds in the twilight before
      supper, and John Mayrant pointed out to me its fine old trees, its placid
      stream, and bade me admire the snug character of the hunting lodge, buried
      away for bachelors&rsquo; delights deep in the heart of the pleasant forest. I
      heard him indulging in memories and anecdotes of date sittings after long
      hunts; but I was myself always on a hunt for my beginning, and none of his
      words clearly reached my intelligence until I was aware of his reciting an
      excellently pertinent couplet:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;If you would hold your father&rsquo;s land,
          You must wash your throat before your hand&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and found myself standing by the lodge table, upon which he had set two
      glasses, containing, I soon ascertained, gin, vermouth, orange bitters,
      and a cherry at the bottom&mdash;all which he had very skillfully mingled
      himself in the happiest proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poetry,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is hereditary in my family;&rdquo; and setting down
      the empty glasses we also washed our hands. A moon half-grown looked in at
      the window from the filmy darkness, and John, catching sight of it, paused
      with the wet soap in his hand and stared out at the dimly visible trees.
      &ldquo;Oh, the times, the times!&rdquo; he murmured to himself, gazing long; and then
      with a sort of start he returned to the present moment, and rinsed and
      dried his hands. Presently we were sitting at the table, pledging each
      other in well-cooled champagne; and it was not long after this that not
      only the negro who waited on us was plainly reveling in John&rsquo;s remarks,
      but also the cook, with her bandannaed ebony head poked round the corner
      of the kitchen door, was doing her utmost to lose no word of this
      entertainment. For John, taking up the young and the old, the quick and
      the dead, of masculine Kings Port, proceeded to narrate their private
      exploits, until by coffee-time he had unrolled for me the richest tapestry
      of gayeties that I remember, and I sat without breath, tearful and aching,
      while the two negroes had retired far into the kitchen to muffle their
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, oh Tom! you Tom!&rdquo; called John Mayrant; and after the man had come
      from the kitchen: &ldquo;You may put the punch-bowl and things on the table, and
      clear away and go to bed. My Great-uncle Marston Chartain,&rdquo; he continued
      to me, &ldquo;was of eccentric taste, and for the last twenty years of his life
      never had anybody to dinner but the undertaker.&rdquo; He paused at this point
      to mix the punch, and then resumed: &ldquo;But for all that, he appears to have
      been a lively old gentleman to the end, and left us his version of a
      saying which is considered by some people an improvement on the original,
      &lsquo;Cherchez la femme.&rsquo; Uncle Marston had it, &lsquo;Hunt the other woman.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t
      go too fast with that punch; it isn&rsquo;t as gentle as it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But John and his Uncle Marston had between them given me my beginning,
      and, as I sat sipping my punch, I ceased to hear the anecdotes which
      followed. I sat sipping and smoking, and was presently aware of the
      deepening silence of the night, and of John no longer at the table, but by
      the window, looking out into the forest, and muttering once more, &ldquo;Oh, the
      times, the times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a triangle,&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round from his window. &ldquo;Triangle?&rdquo; He looked at my glass of
      punch, and then at me. &ldquo;Go easy with the Bombo,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bombo?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;You call this Bombo? You don&rsquo;t know how remarkable
      that is, but that&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know Aunt Carola, who is very
      remarkable, too. Well, never mind her now. Point is, it&rsquo;s always a
      triangle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you&rsquo;re right. And so was your uncle. He knew. Triangle.&rdquo; Here I
      found myself nodding portentously at John, and beating the table with my
      finger very solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by his window seeming to wait for me. And now everything in the
      universe grew perfectly clear to me; I rose on mastering tides of thought,
      and all problems lay disposed of at my feet, while delicious strength and
      calm floated in my brain and being. Nothing was difficult for me. But I
      was getting away from the triangle, and there was John waiting at the
      window, and I mustn&rsquo;t say too much, mustn&rsquo;t say too much. My will reached
      out and caught the triangle and brought it close, and I saw it all
      perfectly clear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the old romances? You take Paris and Helen
      and Menelaus. What&rsquo;s that? You take Launcelot and Arthur and Guinevere.
      You take Paola and Francesca and her husband, what&rsquo;s-his-name, or Tristram
      and Iseult and Mark. Two men, one woman. Triangle and trouble. Other way
      around you get Tannhauser and Venus and Elizabeth; two women, one man;
      more triangle and more trouble. Yes.&rdquo; And I nodded at him again. The tide
      of my thought was pulling me hard away from this to other important
      world-problems, but my will held, struggling, and I kept to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I know what I mean. Trouble is, so hard to advise
      him right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advise who right?&rdquo; inquired John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It helped me wonderfully. My will gripped my floating thoughts and held
      them to it. &ldquo;Friend of mine in trouble; though why he asks me when I&rsquo;m not
      married&mdash;I&rsquo;d be married now, you know, but afraid of only one wife.
      Man doesn&rsquo;t love twice; loves thrice, four, six, lots of times; but they
      say only one wife. Ought to be two, anyhow. Much easier for man to marry
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be rather immoral?&rdquo; John asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morality is queer thing. Like kaleidoscope. New patterns all the time.
      Abraham and wives&mdash;perfectly respectable. You take Pharaohs&mdash;or
      kings of that sort&mdash;married own sisters. All right then. Perfectly
      horrible now, of course. But you ask men about two wives. They&rsquo;d say
      something to be said for that idea. Only there are the women, you know.
      They&rsquo;d never. But I&rsquo;m going to tell my friend he&rsquo;s doing wrong. Going to
      write him to-night. Where&rsquo;s ink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t go to-night,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;What are you going to tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to tell him, since only one wife, wicked not to break his
      engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John looked at me very hard, as he stood by the window, leaning on the
      sill. But my will was getting all the while a stronger hold, and my
      thoughts were less and less inclined to stray to other world-problems;
      moreover, below the confusion that still a little reigned in them was the
      primal cunning of the old Adam, the native man, quite untroubled and alert&mdash;it
      saw John&rsquo;s look at me and it prompted my course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He wants the truth from me. Where&rsquo;s his letter? No harm
      reading you without names.&rdquo; And I fumbled in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letter gone. Never mind. Facts are: friend&rsquo;s asked girl. Girl&rsquo;s said yes.
      Now he thinks he&rsquo;s bound by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks right,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. You take Tannhauser. Engagement to Venus all a mistake.
      Perfectly proper to break it. Much more than proper. Only honorable thing
      he could do. I&rsquo;m going to write it to him. Where&rsquo;s ink?&rdquo; And I got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      John came from his window and sat down at the table. His glass was empty,
      his cigar gone out, and he looked at me. But I looked round the room for
      the ink, noting in my search the big fireplace, simple, wooden,
      unornamented, but generous, and the plain plaster walls of the lodge,
      whereon hung two or three old prints of gamebirds; and all the while I saw
      John out of the corner of my eye, looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke first. &ldquo;Your friend has given his word to a lady; he must stand
      by it like a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lot of difference,&rdquo; I returned, still looking round the room, &ldquo;between
      spirit and letter. If his heart has broken the word, his lips can&rsquo;t make
      him a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John brought his fist down on the table. &ldquo;He had no business to get
      engaged to her! He must take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That blow of the fist on the table brought my thoughts wholly clear and
      fixed on the one subject; my will had no longer to struggle with them,
      they worked of themselves in just the way that I wanted them to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s a gentleman, he must stand to his word,&rdquo; John repeated, &ldquo;unless
      she releases him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fumbled again for my letter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about what he says himself,&rdquo; I
      rejoined, sitting down. &ldquo;He thinks he ought to take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; John Mayrant&rsquo;s face was very stern as he sat in judgment on
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should she take the consequences?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What consequences?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being married to a man who doesn&rsquo;t want her, all her life, until death
      them do part. How&rsquo;s that? Having the daily humiliation of his
      indifference, and the world&rsquo;s knowledge of his indifference. How&rsquo;s that?
      Perhaps having the further humiliation of knowing that his heart belongs
      to another woman. How&rsquo;s that? That&rsquo;s not what a girl bargains for. His
      standing to his word is not an act of honor, but a deception. And in
      talking about &lsquo;taking the consequences,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s patting his personal
      sacrifice on the back and forgetting all about her and the sacrifice he&rsquo;s
      putting her to. What&rsquo;s the brief suffering of a broken engagement to that?
      No: the true consequences that a man should shoulder for making such a
      mistake is the poor opinion that society holds of him for placing a woman
      in such a position; and to free her is the most honorable thing he can do.
      Her dignity suffers less so than if she were a wife chained down to
      perpetual disregard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John, after a silence, said: &ldquo;That is a very curious view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the view I shall give my friend,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I shall tell him
      that in keeping on he is not at bottom honestly thinking of the girl and
      her welfare, but of himself and the public opinion he&rsquo;s afraid of, if he
      breaks his engagement. And I shall tell him that if I&rsquo;m in church and they
      come to the place where they ask if any man knows just cause or
      impediment, I shall probably call out, &lsquo;He does! His heart&rsquo;s not in it.
      This is not marriage that he&rsquo;s committing. You&rsquo;re pronouncing your
      blessing upon a fraud.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John sat now a long time silent, holding his extinct cigar. The lamp was
      almost burned dry; we had blown out the expiring candles some while since.
      &ldquo;That is a very curious view,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I should like to hear what
      your friend says in answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This finished our late sitting. We opened the door and went out for a
      brief space into the night to get its pure breath into our lungs, and look
      to the distant place where the moon had sailed. Then we went to bed, or
      rather, I did; for the last thing that I remembered was John, standing by
      the window of our bedroom still dressed, looking out into the forest.

      XX: What She Wanted Him For
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was neither at the window, nor in his bed, nor anywhere else to be
      seen, when I opened my eyes upon the world next morning; nor did any
      answer come when I called his name. I raised myself and saw outside the
      great branches of the wood, bathed from top to trunk in a sunshine that
      was no early morning&rsquo;s light; and upon this, the silence of the house
      spoke plainly to me not of man still sleeping, but of man long risen and
      gone about his business. I stepped barefoot across the wooden floor to
      where lay my watch, but it marked an unearthly hour, for I had neglected
      to wind it at the end of our long and convivial evening&mdash;of which my
      head was now giving me some news. And then I saw a note addressed to me
      from John Mayrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good sleeper,&rdquo; it began, &ldquo;but my conscience is clear as to the
      Bombo, called by some Kill-devil, about which I hope you will remember
      that I warned you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hoped I should remember! Of course I remembered everything; why did he
      say that? An apology for his leaving me followed; he had been obliged to
      take the early train because of the Custom House, where he was serving his
      final days; they would give me breakfast when ever I should be ready for
      it, and I was to make free of the place; I had better visit the old church
      (they had orders about the keys) and drive myself into Kings Port after
      lunch; the horses would know the way, if I did not. It was the boy&rsquo;s
      closing sentence which fixed my attention wholly, took it away from
      Kill-devil Bombo and my Aunt Carola&rsquo;s commission, for the execution of
      which I now held the clue, and sent me puzzling for the right
      interpretation of his words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that you will help your friend by that advice which startled me
      last night, but which I now begin to see more in than I did. Only between
      alternate injuries, he may find it harder to choose which is the least he
      can inflict, than you, who look on, find it. For in following your
      argument, he benefits himself so plainly that the benefit to the other
      person is very likely obscured to him. But, if you wish to, tell him a
      Southern gentleman would feel he ought to be shot either way. That&rsquo;s the
      honorable price for changing your mind in such a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No interpretation of this came to me. I planned and carried out my day
      according to his suggestion; a slow dressing with much cold water, a slow
      breakfast with much good hot coffee, a slow wandering beneath the dreamy
      branches of Udolpho,&mdash;this course cleared my head of the Bombo, and
      brought back to me our whole evening, and every word I had said to John,
      except that I had lost the solution which, last night, the triangle had
      held for me. At that moment, the triangle, and my whole dealing with the
      subject of monogamy, had seemed to contain the simplicity of genius; but
      it had all gone now, and I couldn&rsquo;t get it back; only, what I had
      contrived to say to John about his own predicament had been certainly well
      said; I would say that over again to-day. It was the boy and the meaning
      of his words which escaped me still, baffled me, and formed the whole
      subject of my attention, even when I was inside the Tern Creek church; so
      that I retain nothing of that, save a general quaintness, a general
      loneliness, a little deserted, forgotten token of human doings long since
      done, standing on its little acre of wilderness amid that solitude which
      suggests the departed presence of man, and which is so much more potent in
      the flavor of its desolation than the virgin wilderness whose solitude is
      still waiting for man to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made no matter whether John had believed in the friend to whom I
      intended writing advice, or had seen through and accepted in good part my
      manoeuvre; he had considered my words, that was the point; and he had not
      slept in his bed, but on it, if sleep had come to him at all; this I found
      out while dressing. Several times I read his note over. &ldquo;Between alternate
      injuries he may find it harder to choose.&rdquo; This was not an answer to me,
      but an explanation of his own perplexity. At times it sounded almost like
      an appeal, as if he were saying, &ldquo;Do not blame me for not being
      convinced;&rdquo; and if it was such appeal, why, then, taken with his resolve
      to do right at any cost, and his night of inward contention, it was
      poignant. &ldquo;I believe that you will help your friend.&rdquo; Those words sounded
      better. But&mdash;&ldquo;tell him a Southern gentleman ought to be shot either
      way.&rdquo; What was the meaning of this? A chill import rose from it into my
      thoughts, but that I dismissed. To die on account of Hortense! Such a
      thing was not to be conceived. And yet, given a high-strung nature, not
      only trapped by its own standards, but also wrought upon during many days
      by increasing exasperation and unhappiness while helpless in the trap, and
      with no other outlook but the trap: the chill import returned to me more
      than once, and was reasoned away, as, with no attention to my
      surroundings, I took a pair of oars, and got into a boat belonging to the
      lodge, and rowed myself slowly among the sluggish windings of Tern Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence come those thoughts that we ourselves feel shame at? It shamed me
      now, as I pulled my boat along, that I should have thoughts of John which
      needed banishing. What tale would this be to remember of a boy&rsquo;s life,
      that he gave it to buy freedom from a pledge which need never have been
      binding? What pearl was this to cast before the sophisticated Hortense?
      Such act would be robbed of its sadness by its absurdity. Yet, surely, the
      bitterest tragedies are those of which the central anguish is lost amid
      the dust of surrounding paltriness. If such a thing should happen here, no
      one but myself would have seen the lonely figure of John Mayrant, standing
      by the window and looking out into the dark quiet of the wood; his name
      would be passed down for a little while as the name of a fool, and then he
      would be forgotten. &ldquo;I believe that you will help your friend.&rdquo; Yes; he
      had certainly written that, and it now came to me that I might have said
      to him one thing more: Had he given Hortense the chance to know what his
      feelings to her had become? But he would merely have answered that here it
      was the duty of a gentleman to lie. Or, had he possibly, at Newport, ever
      become her lover too much for any escaping now? Had his dead passion once
      put his honor in a pawn which only marriage could redeem? This might fit
      all that had come, so far; and still, with such a two as they, I should
      forever hold the boy the woman&rsquo;s victim. But this did not fit what came
      after. Perhaps it was the late sitting of the night before, and the hushed
      and strange solitude of my surroundings now, that had laid my mind open to
      all these thoughts which my reason, in dealing with, answered continually,
      one by one, yet which returned, requiring to be answered again; for there
      are times when our uncomfortable eyes see through the appearances we have
      arranged for daily life, into the actualities which lie forever behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going about thus in my boat, I rowed sleepiness into myself, and pushed
      into a nook where shade from some thick growth hid the boat and me from
      the sun; and there, almost enmeshed in the deep lattice of green, I placed
      my coat beneath my head, and prone in the boat&rsquo;s bottom I drifted into
      slumber. Once or twice my oblivion was pierced by the roaming honk of the
      automobile; but with no more than the half-melted consciousness that the
      Replacers were somewhere in the wood, oblivion closed over me again; and
      when it altogether left me, it was because of voices near me on the water,
      or on the bank. Their calls and laughter pushed themselves into my
      drowsiness, and soon after I grew aware that the Replacers were come here
      to see what was to be seen at Udolpho&mdash;the club, the old church, a
      country place with a fine avenue&mdash;and that it was the church they now
      couldn&rsquo;t get into, because my visit had disturbed the usual whereabouts of
      the key, of which Gazza was now going in search. I could have told him
      where to find it, but it pleased me not to disturb myself for this, as I
      listened to him assuring Kitty that it was probably in the cabin beyond
      the bridge, but not to be alarmed if he did not immediately return with
      it. Kitty, not without audible mirth, assured him that they should not be
      alarmed at all, to which the voice of Hortense supplemented, &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
       They were evidently in a boat, which Hortense herself was rowing, and
      which she seemed to bring to the bank, where I gathered that Kitty got out
      and sat while Hortense remained in the boat. There was the little talk and
      movement which goes with borrowing of a cigarette, a little exclamation
      about not falling out, accompanied by the rattle of a displaced oar, and
      then stillness, and the smell of tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Kitty spoke. &ldquo;Charley will be back to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this I heard no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did his telegram say?&rdquo; Kitty inquired, after another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; This was Hortense. Her slow, rich murmur was as
      deliberate as always.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bohm knew it would be,&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;He said it wouldn&rsquo;t take five
      minutes&rsquo; talk from Charley to get a contract worth double what they were
      going to accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, nothing came to me for several minutes, save the odor of the
      cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was now but one proper course for me, namely, to utter a
      discreet cough, and thus warn them that some one was within earshot. But I
      didn&rsquo;t! I couldn&rsquo;t! Strength failed, curiosity won, my baser nature
      triumphed here, and I deliberately remained lying quiet and hidden. It was
      the act of no gentleman, you will say. Well, it was; and I must simply
      confess to it, hoping that I am not the only gentleman in the world who
      has, on occasion, fallen beneath himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hortense Rieppe,&rdquo; began Kitty, &ldquo;what do you intend to say to my brother
      after what he has done about those phosphates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is always so kind,&rdquo; murmured Hortense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you persist in this folly, you&rsquo;ll drop out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense chose another line of speculation. &ldquo;I wonder why your brother is
      so sure of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley is a set man. And I&rsquo;ve never seen him so set on anything as on
      you, Hortense Rieppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is always so kind,&rdquo; murmured Hortense again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man you&rsquo;ll always know just where to find,&rdquo; declared Kitty.
      &ldquo;Charley is safe. He&rsquo;ll never take you by surprise, never fly out, never
      do what other people don&rsquo;t do, never make any one stare at him by the way
      he looks, or the way he acts, or anything he says, or&mdash;or&mdash;why,
      how you can hesitate between those two men after that ridiculous,
      childish, conspicuous, unusual scene on the bridge&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unusual. Yes,&rdquo; said Hortense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty&rsquo;s eloquence and voice mounted together. &ldquo;I should think it was
      unusual! Tearing people&rsquo;s money up, and making a rude, awkward fuss that
      everybody had to smooth over as hard as they could! Why, even Mr. Rodgers
      says that sort of thing isn&rsquo;t done, and you&rsquo;re always saying he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hortense. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never seen anything approaching such behavior in our set. And
      he was ready to go further. Nobody knows where it might have gone to, if
      Charley&rsquo;s perfect coolness hadn&rsquo;t rebuked him and brought him to his
      senses. There&rsquo;s where it is, that&rsquo;s what I mean, Hortense, by saying you
      could always feel safe with Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense put in a languid word. &ldquo;I think I should always feel safe with
      Mr. Mayrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty was a simple soul. &ldquo;Indeed you couldn&rsquo;t, Hortense! I assure you
      that you&rsquo;re mistaken. There&rsquo;s where you get so wrong about men sometimes.
      I have been studying that boy for your sake ever since we got here, and I
      know him through and through. And I tell you, you cannot count upon him.
      He has not been used to our ways, and I see no promise of his getting used
      to them. He will stay capable of outbreaks like that horrid one on the
      bridge. Wherever you take him, wherever you put him, no matter how much
      you show him of us, and the way we don&rsquo;t allow conspicuous things like
      that to occur, believe me, Hortense, he&rsquo;ll never learn, he&rsquo;ll never smooth
      down. You may brush his hair flat and keep him appearing like other people
      for a while, but a time will come, something will happen, and that boy&rsquo;ll
      be conspicuous. Charley would never be conspicuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented Hortense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty urged her point. &ldquo;Why, I never saw or beard of anything like that on
      the bridge&mdash;that is, among&mdash;among&mdash;us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented Hortense, again, and her voice dropped lower with each
      statement. &ldquo;One always sees the same thing. Always hears the same thing.
      Always the same thing.&rdquo; These last almost inaudible words sank away into
      the silent pool of Hortense&rsquo;s meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have another cigarette,&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve let yours fall into the
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard them moving a little, and then they must have resumed their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drop out of it,&rdquo; Kitty now pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into what shall I drop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just being asked to the big things everybody goes to and nobody counts.
      For even with the way Charley has arranged about the phosphates, it will
      not be enough to keep you in our swim&mdash;just by itself. He&rsquo;ll weigh
      more than his money, because he&rsquo;ll stay different&mdash;too different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not so different last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was not there long enough, my dear. He learned bridge quickly,
      and of course he had seen champagne before, and nobody had time to notice
      him. But he&rsquo;ll be married now and they will notice him, and they won&rsquo;t
      want him. To think of your dropping out!&rdquo; Kitty became very earnest. &ldquo;To
      think of not seeing you among us! You&rsquo;ll be in none of the small things;
      you&rsquo;ll never be asked to stay at the smart houses&mdash;why, not even your
      name will be in the paper! Not a foreigner you entertain, not a dinner you
      give, not a thing you wear, will ever be described next morning. And
      Charley&rsquo;s so set on you, and you&rsquo;re so just exactly made for each other,
      and it would all be so splendid, and cosey, and jolly! And to throw all
      this away for that crude boy!&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s disdain was high at the thought of
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hortense took a little time over it &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; she then stated, &ldquo;he told me
      he could drown in my hair as joyfully as the Duke of Clarence did in his
      butt of Malmsey wine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty gave a little scream. &ldquo;Did you let him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One has to guard one&rsquo;s value at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty&rsquo;s disdain for John increased. &ldquo;How crude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense did not make any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How crude!&rdquo; Kitty, after some silence, repeated. She seemed to have found
      the right word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steps sounded upon the bridge, and the voice of Gazza cried out that the
      stupid key was at the imbecile club-house, whither he was now going for
      it, and not to be alarmed. Their voices answered reassuringly, and Gazza
      was heard growing distant, singing some little song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was apparently unable to get away from John&rsquo;s crudity. &ldquo;He actually
      said that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it? Tell me about it, Hortense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were walking in the country on that occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty still lingered with it. &ldquo;Did he look&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never had any man&mdash;I
      wonder if&mdash;how did you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not disagreeably.&rdquo; And Hortense permitted herself to laugh musically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty&rsquo;s voice at once returned to the censorious tone. &ldquo;Well, I call such
      language as that very&mdash;very&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense helped her. &ldquo;Operatic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could never be taught in those ways either,&rdquo; declared Kitty. &ldquo;You
      would find his ardor always untrained&mdash;provincial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Hortense abstained from making any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty grew superior. &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s to your taste, Hortense Rieppe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was none of it like Charley,&rdquo; murmured Hortense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not! Charley&rsquo;s not crude. What do you see in that man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the way his hair curls above his ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For this Kitty found nothing but an impatient exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the voice of Hortense sank still deeper in dreaminess,&mdash;down
      to where the truth lay; and from those depths came the truth, flashing
      upward through the drowsy words she spoke: &ldquo;I think I want him for his
      innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What light these words may have brought to Kitty, I had no chance to
      learn; for the voice of Gazza returning with the key put an end to this
      conversation. But I doubted if Kitty had it in her to fathom the nature of
      Hortense. Kitty was like a trim little clock that could tick tidily on an
      ornate shelf; she could go, she could keep up with time, with the rapid
      epoch to which she belonged, but she didn&rsquo;t really have many works. I
      think she would have scoffed at that last languorous speech as a piece of
      Hortense&rsquo;s nonsense, and that is why Hortense uttered it aloud: she was
      safe from being understood. But in my ears it sounded the note of
      revelation, the simple central secret of Hortense&rsquo;s fire, a flame fed
      overmuch with experience, with sophistication, grown cold under the
      ministrations of adroitness, and lighted now by the &ldquo;crudity&rdquo; of John&rsquo;s
      love-making. And when, after an interval, I had rowed my boat back, and
      got into the carriage, and started on my long drive from Udolpho to Kings
      Port, I found that there was almost nothing about all this which I did not
      know now. Hortense, like most riddles when you are told the answer, was
      clear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I want him for his innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes; she was tired of love-making whose down had been rubbed off; she
      hungered for love-making with the down still on, even if she must pay for
      it with marriage. Who shall say if her enlightened and modern eye could
      not look beyond such marriage (when it should grow monotonous) to divorce?

    <h2>
      XXI: Hortense&rsquo;s Cigarette Goes Out
    </h2>
    <p>
      John was the riddle that I could not read. Among my last actions of this
      day was one that had been almost my earliest, and bedtime found me staring
      at his letter, as I stood, half undressed, by my table. The calm moon
      brought back Udolpho and what had been said there, as it now shone down
      upon the garden where Hortense had danced. I stared at John&rsquo;s letter as if
      its words were new to me, instead of being words that I could have
      fluently repeated from beginning to end without an error; it was as if, by
      virtue of mere gazing at the document, I hoped to wring more meaning from
      it, to divine what had been in the mind which had composed it; but instead
      of this, I seemed to get less from it, instead of more. Had the boy&rsquo;s
      purpose been to mystify me, he could scarce have done better. I think that
      he had no such intention, for it would have been wholly unlike him; but I
      saw no sign in it that I had really helped him, had really shaken his old
      quixotic resolve, nor did I see any of his having found a new way of his
      own out of the trap. I could not believe that the dark road of escape had
      taken any lodgement in his thought, but had only passed over it, like a
      cloud with a heavy shadow. But these are surmises at the best: if John had
      formed any plan, I can never know it, and Juno&rsquo;s remarks at breakfast on
      Sunday morning sounded strange, like something a thousand miles away. For
      she spoke of the wedding, and of the fact that it would certainly be a
      small one. She went over the names of the people who would have to be
      invited, and doubted if she were one of these. But if she should be, then
      she would go&mdash;for the sake of Miss Josephine St. Michael, she
      declared. In short, it was perfectly plain that Juno was much afraid of
      being left out, and that wild horses could not drag her away from it, if
      an invitation came to her. But, as I say, this side of the wedding seemed
      to have nothing to do with it, when I thought of all that lay beneath; my
      one interest to-day was to see John Mayrant, to get from him, if not by
      some word, then by some look or intonation, a knowledge of what he meant
      to do. Therefore, disappointment and some anxiety met me when I stepped
      from the Hermana&rsquo;s gangway upon her deck, and Charley asked me if he was
      coming. But the launch, sent back to wait, finally brought John,
      apologizing for his lateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, I was pleased to find among the otherwise complete party
      General Rieppe. What I had seen of him from a distance held promise, and
      the hero&rsquo;s nearer self fulfilled it. We fell to each other&rsquo;s lot for the
      most natural of reasons: nobody else desired the company of either of us.
      Charley was making himself the devoted servant of Hortense, while Kitty
      drew Beverly, Bohm, and Gazza in her sprightly wake. To her, indeed, I
      made a few compliments during the first few minutes after my coming
      aboard, while every sort of drink and cigar was being circulated among us
      by the cabin boy. Kitty&rsquo;s costume was the most markedly maritime thing
      that I have ever beheld in any waters, and her white shoes looked (I must
      confess) supremely well on her pretty little feet. I am no advocate of
      sumptuary laws; but there should be one prohibiting big-footed women from
      wearing white shoes. Did these women know what a spatulated effect their
      feet so shod produce, no law would be needed. Yes, Kitty was
      superlatively, stridently maritime; you could have known from a great
      distance that she belonged to the very latest steam yacht class, and that
      she was perfectly ignorant of the whole subject. On her left arm, for
      instance, was worked a red propeller with one blade down, and two
      chevrons. It was the rating mark for a chief engineer, but this, had she
      known it, would not have disturbed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I chose it,&rdquo; she told me in reply to my admiration of it, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s
      so pretty. Oh, won&rsquo;t we enjoy ourselves while those stupid old blue-bloods
      in Kings Port are going to church!&rdquo; And with this she gave a skip, and
      ordered the cabin boy to bring her a Remsen cooler. Beverly Rodgers called
      for dwarf&rsquo;s blood, and I chose a horse&rsquo;s neck, and soon found myself in
      the society of the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sipping whiskey and plain water. &ldquo;I am a rough soldiers sir,&rdquo; he
      explained to me, &ldquo;and I keep to the simple beverage of the camp. Had we
      not &lsquo;rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not
      of&rsquo;?&rdquo; And he waved a stately hand at my horse&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;You are acquainted
      with the works of Shakespeare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I had a moderate knowledge of them, and assured him that a
      horse&rsquo;s neck was very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, sir; but a veteran is ever old-fashioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Hortense, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let the sun shine upon your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, daughter mine.&rdquo; They said no more; but I presently felt that
      for some reason she watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved farther beneath the awning, and I followed him. &ldquo;Are you a
      father, sir? No? Then you cannot appreciate what it is to confide such a
      jewel as yon girl to another&rsquo;s keeping.&rdquo; He summoned the cabin boy, who
      brought him some more of the simple beverage of the camp, and I, feeling
      myself scarce at liberty to speak on matters so near to him and so far
      from me as his daughter&rsquo;s marriage, called his attention to the beautiful
      aspect of Kings Port, spread out before us in a long white line against
      the blue water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General immediately seized his opportunity. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sweet Auburn, loveliest
      village of the plain!&rsquo; You are acquainted with the works of Goldsmith,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I professed some knowledge of this author also, and the General&rsquo;s talk
      flowed ornately onward. Though I had little to say to him about his
      daughter&rsquo;s marriage, he had much to say to me. Miss Josephine St. Michael
      would have been gratified to hear that her family was considered suitable
      for Hortense to contract an alliance with. &ldquo;My girl is not stepping down,
      sir,&rdquo; the father assured me; and he commended the St. Michaels and the
      whole connection. He next alluded tragically but vaguely to misfortunes
      which had totally deprived him of income. I could not precisely fix what
      his inheritance had been; sometimes he spoke of cotton, but next it would
      be rice, and he touched upon sugar more than once; but, whatever it was,
      it had been vast and was gone. He told me that I could not imagine the
      feelings of a father who possessed a jewel and no dowry to give her. &ldquo;A
      queen&rsquo;s estate should have been hers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what! &lsquo;Who steals my
      purse steals trash.&rsquo;&rdquo; And he sat up, nobly braced by the philosophic
      thought. But he soon was shaking his head over his enfeebled health. Was I
      aware that he had been the cause of postponing the young people&rsquo;s joy
      twice? Twice had the doctors forbidden him to risk the emotions that would
      attend his giving his jewel away. He dwelt upon his shattered system to
      me, and, indeed, it required some dwelling on, for he was the picture of
      admirable preservation. &ldquo;But I know what it is myself,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;to
      be a lover and have bliss delayed. They shall be united now. A soldier
      must face all arrows. What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had hoped he might quote something here, but was disappointed. His
      conversation would soon cease to interest me, should I lose the excitement
      of watching for the next classic; and my eye wandered from the General to
      the water, where, happily, I saw John Mayrant coming in the launch. I
      briskly called the General&rsquo;s attention to him, and was delighted with the
      unexpected result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, young Lochinvar has come out of the West,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the General,
      lifting his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      I touched it ceremoniously with mine. &ldquo;The day will be hot,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;&lsquo;The
      boy stood on the burning deck.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this I made my escape from him, and, leaving him to his whiskey and his
      contemplating, I became aware that the eyes of the rest of the party were
      eager to watch the greeting between Hortense and John. But there was
      nothing to see. Hortense waited until her lover had made his apologies to
      Charley for being late, and, from the way they met, she might have been no
      more to him than Kitty was. Whatever might be thought, whatever might be
      known, by these onlookers, Hortense set the pace of how the open secret
      was to be taken. She made it, for all of us, as smooth and smiling as the
      waters of Kings Port were this fine day. How much did they each know? I
      asked myself how much they had shared in common. To these Replacers Kings
      Port had opened no doors; they and their automobile had skirted around the
      outside of all things. And if Charley knew about the wedding, he also knew
      that it had been already twice postponed. He, too, could have said, as
      Miss Eliza had once said to me, &ldquo;The cake is not baked yet.&rdquo; The General&rsquo;s
      talk to me (I felt as I took in how his health had been the centred point)
      was probably the result of previous arrangements with Hortense herself;
      and she quite as certainly inspired whatever she allowed him to say to
      Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Kitty, she knew that her brother was &ldquo;set&rdquo;; she always came back to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Hortense found this Sunday morning a passage of particularly delicate
      steering, she showed it in no way, unless by that heightened radiance and
      triumph of beauty which I had seen in her before. No; the splendor of the
      day, the luxuries of the Hermana, the conviviality of the Replacers&mdash;all
      melted the occasion down to an ease and enjoyment in which even John
      Mayrant, with his grave face, was not perceptible, unless, like myself,
      one watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my full expectation that we should now get under way and proceed
      among the various historic sights of Kings Port harbor, but of this I saw
      no signs anywhere on board the Hermana. Abeam of the foremast her boat
      booms remained rigged out on port and starboard, her boats riding to
      painters, while her crew wore a look as generally lounging as that of her
      passengers. Beverly Rodgers told me the reason: we had no pilot; the negro
      Waterman engaged for this excursion in the upper waters had failed of
      appearance, and when Charley was for looking up another, Kitty, Bohm, and
      Gazza had dissuaded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said Beverly, &ldquo;told me she didn&rsquo;t care about the musty old forts
      and things, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Kitty, and heard her tongue ticking away, like the little
      clock she was; she had her Bohm, she had her nautical costume and her
      Remsen cooler. These, with the lunch that would come in time, were enough
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was such a good chance!&rdquo; I exclaimed in disappointment
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance for what, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see everything&mdash;the forts, the islands&mdash;and it&rsquo;s beautiful,
      you know, all the way to the navy yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beverly followed my glance to where the gay company was sitting among the
      cracked ice, and bottles, and cigar boxes, chattering volubly, with its
      back to the scenery. He gave his laisser-faire chuckle, and laid a hand on
      my shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &lsquo;em with forts and islands, old boy! They know
      what they want. No living breed on earth knows better what it wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cold fear of ennui gnaws at their vitals this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shrill laughter from Kitty and Gazza served to refute my theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, very few know what&rsquo;s the matter with them,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;You
      seldom spot an organic disease at the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; said Beverly, lengthily. &ldquo;You put a pin through some of &lsquo;em.
      Hortense hasn&rsquo;t got the disease, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, she spotted it! She&rsquo;s taking treatment. It&rsquo;s likely to help her&mdash;for
      a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me. &ldquo;You know something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. He looked at Hortense, who was now seated among the noisy group
      with quiet John beside her. She was talking to Bohm, she had no air of any
      special relation to John, but there was a lustre about her that spoke well
      for the treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s coming off?&rdquo; said Beverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been too much for him,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly misunderstood. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the fool can cut loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you and I have gone over all that! I&rsquo;ve even gone over it with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beverly looked at Hortense again. &ldquo;And her fire-eater&rsquo;s fortune is about
      double what it would have been. I don&rsquo;t see how she&rsquo;s going to square
      herself with Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll wait till that&rsquo;s necessary. It isn&rsquo;t necessary to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had to drop our subject here, for the owner of the Hermana approached
      us with the amiable purpose, I found, of making himself civil for a while
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you would have been interested to see the navy yard,&rdquo; I said to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen it,&rdquo; Charley replied, in his slightly foreign, careful voice.
      &ldquo;It is not a navy yard. It is small politics and a big swamp. I was not
      interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;But surely it&rsquo;s going to be very fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another gold brick sold to Uncle Sam.&rdquo; Charley&rsquo;s words seemed always to
      drop out like little accurately measured coins from some minting machine.
      &ldquo;They should not have changed from the old place if they wanted a harbor
      that could be used in war-time. Here they must always keep at least one
      dredge going out at the jetties. So the enemy blows up your dredge and you
      are bottled in, or bottled out. It is very simple for the enemy. And, for
      Kings Port, navy yards do not galvanize dead trade. It was a gold brick.
      You have not been on the Hermana before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew that I had not, but he wishes to show her to me; and I soon noted
      a difference as radical as it was diverting between this
      banker-yachtsman&rsquo;s speech when he talked of affairs on land and when he
      attempted to deal with nautical matters. The clear, dispassionate finality
      of his tone when phosphates, or railroads, or navy yards, or imperial
      loans were concerned, left him, and changed to something very like a
      recitation of trigonometry well memorized but not at all mastered; he
      could do that particular sum, but you mustn&rsquo;t stop him; and I concluded
      that I would rather have Charley for my captain during a panic in Wall
      Street than in a hurricane at sea. He, too, wore highly pronounced sea
      clothes of the ornamental kind; and though they fitted him physically,
      they hung baggily upon his unmarine spirit; giving him the air, as it
      were, of a broiled quail served on oyster shells. Beverly Rodgers, the
      consummate Beverly, was the only man of us whose clothes seemed to belong
      to him; he looked as if he could sail a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the cabin boy continued to rush among the guests with siphons, ice,
      and fresh refreshments, Charley became the Hermana&rsquo;s guidebook for me; and
      our interview gave me, I may say, entertainment unalloyed, although there
      lay all the while, beneath the entertainment, my sadness and concern about
      John. Charley was owner of the Hermana, there was no doubt of that; she
      had cost him (it was not long before he told me) fifty thousand dollars,
      and to run her it cost him a thousand a month. Yes, he was her owner, but
      there it stopped, no matter with how solemn a face he inspected each part
      of her, or spoke of her details; he was as much a passenger on her as
      myself; and this was as plain on the equally solemn faces of his crew,
      from the sailing-master down through the two quartermasters to the five
      deck-hands, as was the color of the Hermana&rsquo;s stack, which was, of course,
      yellow. She was a pole-mast, schooner-rigged steam yacht, Charley
      accurately told me, with clipper bow and spiked bowsprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a hundred tons?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A hundred feet long, beam twenty feet, and she draws twelve feet,&rdquo;
       said Charley; and I thought I detected the mate listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now called my attention to the flags, and I am certain that I saw the
      sailing-master hide his mouth with his hand. Some of the deck-hands seemed
      to gather delicately nearer to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday, of course,&rdquo; I said; and I pointed to the Jack flying from a staff
      at the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Charley did not wish me to tell him about the flags, he wished to tell
      me about the flags. &ldquo;I am very strict about all this,&rdquo; he said, his
      gravity and nauticality increasing with every word. &ldquo;At the fore truck
      flies our club burgee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went through my part, giving a solemn, silent, intelligent assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my private signal at the main truck. It was designed by Miss
      Rieppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I again intelligently nodded, I saw the boatswain move an elbow into
      the ribs of one of the quartermasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the staff at the taffrail I have the United States yacht ensign,&rdquo;
       Charley continued. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said, looking about for more flags,
      and (to his disappointment, I think) finding no more. For he added: &ldquo;But
      at twelve o&rsquo;c&mdash;at eight bells, the crew&rsquo;s meal-flag will be in the
      port fore rigging. While we are at lunch, my meal-flag will be in the
      starboard main rigging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should be there all day,&rdquo; I was tempted to remark to him, as my
      wandering eye fell on the cabin boy carrying something more on a plate to
      Kitty. But instead of this I said: &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a beautiful boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get rid of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she all right?&rdquo; It seemed to me that the crew
      behind us were very attentive now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not enough refrigerator space,&rdquo; said Charley. One of the
      deck-hands whirled round instantly; but stolidity sat like adamant upon
      the faces of the others as Charley turned in their direction, and we
      continued our tour of the Hermana. Thus the little banker let me see his
      little soul, deep down; and there I saw that to pass for a real yachtsman&mdash;which
      he would never be able to do&mdash;was dearer to his pride than to bring
      off successfully some huge and delicate matter in the world&rsquo;s finance&mdash;which
      he could always do supremely well. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just like that, too,&rdquo; I thought to
      myself; and we returned to the gay Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty, despite her gayety, had serious thoughts upon her mind.
      Charley&rsquo;s attentions to me had met all that politeness required, and as we
      went aft again, his sister caused certain movements and rearrangements to
      happen with chairs and people. I didn&rsquo;t know this at once, but I knew it
      when I found myself somehow sitting with her and John, and saw Hortense
      with Charley. Hortense looked over at Kitty with a something that had in
      it both raised eyebrows and a shrug, though these visible signs did not
      occur; and, indeed, so far as anything visible went (except the look) you
      might have supposed that now Hortense had no thoughts for any man in the
      world save Charley. And John was plainly more at ease with Kitty! He began
      to make himself agreeable, so that once or twice she gave him a glance of
      surprise. There was nothing to mark him out from the others, except his
      paleness in the midst of their redness. Yachting clothes bring out
      wonderfully how much you are in the habit of eating and drinking; and an
      innocent stranger might have supposed that the Replacers were richly
      sunburned from exposure to the blazing waters of Cuba and the tropics.
      Kitty deemed it suitable to extol Kings Port to John. &ldquo;Quaint&rdquo; was the
      word that did most of this work for her; she found everything that, even
      the negroes; and when she had come to the end of it, she supposed the
      inside must be just as &ldquo;quaint&rdquo; as the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said John Mayrant. He was enjoying Kitty. Then he became
      impertinent. &ldquo;You ought to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you stay inside much?&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all do,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Some of us never come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you came out?&rdquo; Kitty suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been out,&rdquo; John returned. He was getting older. I doubt if the
      past few years of his life had matured him as much as had the past few
      days. Then he looked at Kitty in the eyes. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d always come out&mdash;if
      Romance rang the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;Then you know that ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We begin to hear it early in Kings Port,&rdquo; remarked John. &ldquo;About the age
      of fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked at him with an interest that now plainly revealed curiosity
      also. It occurred to me that he could not have found any great
      embarrassment in getting on at Newport. &ldquo;What if I rang the bell myself?&rdquo;
       explained Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in the evening,&rdquo; returned John. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go home till morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty kissed her hand to him, and, during the pleased giggle that she
      gave, I saw her first taking in John and then Hortense. Kitty was
      thinking, thinking, of John&rsquo;s &ldquo;crudity.&rdquo; And so I made a little experiment
      for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if men seem as similar in making love as women do in receiving
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shouted both John and Kitty, in the same indignant breath.
      Their noise brought Bohm to listen to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment was so much a success that I promptly made another for the
      special benefit of Bohm, Kitty&rsquo;s next husband. I find it often delightful
      to make a little gratuitous mischief, just to watch the victims. I
      addressed Kitty. &ldquo;What would you do if a man said he could drown in your
      hair as joyfully as the Duke of Clarence did in his butt of Malmsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Kitty, &ldquo;why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose it gave John time; but even so he was splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has heard it said!&rdquo; This was his triumphant shout. I should not have
      supposed that Kitty could have turned any redder, but she did. John buried
      his nose in his tall glass, and gulped a choking quantity of its contents,
      and mopped his face profusely; but little good that effected. There sat
      this altogether innocent pair, deeply suffused with the crimson of
      apparent guilt, and there stood Kitty&rsquo;s next husband, eyeing them
      suspiciously. My little gratuitous mischief was a perfect success, and
      remains with me as one of the bright spots in this day of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vivacious measures from the piano brought Kitty to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Gazza!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make him sing!&rdquo; And on the instant she
      was gone down the companionway. Bohm followed her with a less agitated
      speed, and soon all were gone below, leaving John and me alone on the
      deck, sitting together in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      John lolled back in his chair, slowly sipping at his tall glass, and
      neither of us made any remark. I think he wanted to ask me how I came to
      mention the Duke of Clarence; but I did not see how he very well could,
      and he certainly made no attempt to do so. Thus did we sit for some time,
      hearing the piano and the company grow livelier and louder with solos, and
      choruses, and laughter. By and by the shadow of the awning shifted,
      causing me to look up, when I saw the shores slowly changing; the tide had
      turned, and was beginning to run out. Land and water lay in immense peace;
      the long, white, silent picture of the town with its steeples on the one
      hand, and on the other the long, low shore, and the trees behind. Into
      this rose the high voice of Gazza, singing in broken English,
      &ldquo;Razzla-dazzla, razzla-dazzla,&rdquo; while his hearers beat upon glasses with
      spoons&mdash;at least so I conjectured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming, John?&rdquo; asked Hortense, appearing at the companionway.
      She looked very bacchanalian. Her splendid amber hair was half riotous,
      and I was reminded of the toboggan fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed her; and now I had the deck entirely to myself, or, rather, but
      one other and distant person shared it with me. The hour had come, the
      bells had struck; Charley&rsquo;s crew was eating its dinner below forward;
      Charley&rsquo;s guests were drinking their liquor below aft; Charley&rsquo;s correct
      meal-flag was to be seen in the port fore rigging, as he had said, red and
      triangular; and away off from me in the bow was the anchor watch, whom I
      dreamily watched trying to light his pipe. His matches seemed to be bad;
      and the brotherly thought of helping him drifted into my mind&mdash;and
      comfortably out of it again, without disturbing my agreeable repose. It
      had been really entertaining in John to tell Kitty that she ought to see
      the inside of Kings Port; that was like his engaging impishness with Juno.
      If by any possible contrivance (and none was possible) Kitty and her
      Replacers could have met the inside of Kings Port, Kitty would have added
      one more &ldquo;quaint&rdquo; impression to her stock, and gone away in total
      ignorance of the quality of the impression she had made&mdash;and Bohm
      would probably have again remarked, &ldquo;Worse than Sunday.&rdquo; No; the St.
      Michaels and the Replacers would never meet in this world, and I see no
      reason that they should in the next. John&rsquo;s light and pleasing skirmish
      with Kitty gave me the glimpse of his capacities which I had lacked
      hitherto. John evidently &ldquo;knew his way about,&rdquo; as they say; and I was
      diverted to think how Miss Josephine St. Michael would have nodded over
      his adequacy and shaken her head at his squandering it on such a
      companion. But it was no squandering; the boy&rsquo;s heavy spirit was making a
      gallant &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; at playing up with the lively party he had no choice but
      to join, and this one saw the moment he was not called upon to play up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peaceful loveliness that floated from earth and water around me
      triumphed over the jangling hilarity of the cabin, and I dozed away, aware
      that they were now all thumping furiously in chorus, while Gazza sang
      something that went, &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s my leetle preety poosee pet.&rdquo; When I
      roused, it was Kitty&rsquo;s voice at the piano, but no change in the quality of
      the song or the thumping; and Hortense was stepping on deck. She had a
      cigarette, her beauty flashed with devilment, and John followed her. &ldquo;They
      are going to have an explanation,&rdquo; I thought, as I saw his face. If that
      were so, then Kitty had blundered in her strategy and hurt Charley&rsquo;s
      cause; for after the two came Gazza, as obviously &ldquo;sent&rdquo; as any emissary
      ever looked: Kitty took care of the singing, while Gazza intercepted any
      tete-a-tete. I rose and made a fourth with them, and even as I was drawing
      near, the devilment in Hortense&rsquo;s face sank inward beneath cold
      displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never been a welcome person to Hortense, and she made as little
      effort to conceal this as usual. Her indifferent eyes glanced at me with
      drowsy insolence, and she made her beautiful, low voice as remote and
      inattentive as her skilful social equipment could render it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so hot in the cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all she had for me. Then she looked at Gazza with returning
      animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la la!&rdquo; said Gazza. &ldquo;If it is hot in the cabin!&rdquo; And he flirted his
      handkerchief back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had the best of it,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;All the melody and none of
      the temperature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense saw no need of noticing me further
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The singer has the worst of it,&rdquo; said Gazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since you all sang!&rdquo; I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rieppe, she is cool,&rdquo; continued Gazza. &ldquo;And she danced. It is not
      fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John contributed nothing. He was by no means playing up now. He was
      looking away at the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazza hummed a little fragment. &ldquo;But after lunch I will sing you good
      music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as it keeps us cool,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no! It will not be cool music!&rdquo; cried Gazza&mdash;&ldquo;for those who
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are those boys bathing?&rdquo; Hortense now inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      We watched the distant figures, and presently they flashed into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, me!&rdquo; sighed Gazza. &ldquo;If I were a boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense looked at him. &ldquo;You would be afraid.&rdquo; The devilment had come out
      again, suddenly and brilliantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never have been afraid!&rdquo; declared Gazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not jump in after me,&rdquo; said Hortense, taking his measure more
      and more provokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazza laid his hand on his heart. &ldquo;Where you go, I will go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hortense looked at him, and laughed very slightly and lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it! I swear!&rdquo; protested Gazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes were now fixed upon Hortense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you go?&rdquo; she asked him
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly not!&rdquo; he returned. I don&rsquo;t know whether he was angry or
      anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you would!&rdquo; said Hortense; and she jumped into the water,
      cigarette and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a boat, quick,&rdquo; said John to me; and with his coat flung off he was
      in the river, whose current Hortense could scarce have reckoned with; for
      they were both already astern as I ran out on the port boat boom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazza was dancing and shrieking, &ldquo;Man overboard!&rdquo; which, indeed, was the
      correct expression, only it did not apply to himself. Gazza was a very
      sensible person. I had, as I dropped into the nearest boat, a brisk sight
      of the sailing-master, springing like a jack-in-the-box on the deserted
      deck, with a roar of &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that haymaker?&rdquo; His reference was to the
      anchor watch. The temptation to procure good matches to light his pipe had
      ended (I learned later) by proving too much for this responsible
      sailor-man, and he had unfortunately chosen for going below just the
      unexpected moment when it had entered the daring head of Hortense to
      perform this extravagance. Of course, before I had pulled many strokes,
      the deck of the Hermana was alive with many manifestations of life-saving
      and they had most likely been in time. But I am not perfectly sure of
      this; the current was strong, and a surprising distance seemed to broaden
      between me and the Hermana before another boat came into sight around her
      stern. By then, or just after that (for I cannot clearly remember the
      details of these few anxious minutes), I had caught up with John, whose
      face, and total silence, as he gripped the stern of the boat with one hand
      and held Hortense with the other, plainly betrayed it was high time
      somebody came. A man can swim (especially in salt water) with his shoes
      on, and his clothes add nothing of embarrassment, if his arms are free;
      but a woman&rsquo;s clothes do not help either his buoyancy or the freedom of
      his movement. John now lifted Hortense&rsquo;s two hands, which took a good hold
      of the boat. From between her lips the dishevelled cigarette, bitten
      through and limp, fell into the water. The boat felt the weight of the two
      hands to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; I warned John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hortense opened her eyes and looked at me; she knew that I meant her.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not swamp you.&rdquo; This was her first remark. Her next was when, after
      no incautious haste, I had hauled her in over the stern, John working
      round to the bow for the sake of balance: &ldquo;I was not dressed for
      swimming.&rdquo; Very quietly did Hortense speak; very coolly, very evenly; no
      fainting&mdash;and no flippancy; she was too game for either.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, whatever emotions she had felt, or was feeling, she showed
      none of them, unless it was by her complete silence. John&rsquo;s coming into
      the boat we managed with sufficient dexterity; aided by the horrified
      Charley, who now arrived personally in the other boat, and was for taking
      all three of us into that. But this was altogether unnecessary; he was
      made to understand that such transferences as it would occasion were
      superfluous, and so one of his men stepped into our boat to help me to row
      back against the current; and for this I was not unthankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our return took, it appeared to me, a much longer time than everything
      else which had happened. When I looked over my shoulder at the Hermana,
      she seemed an incredible distance off, and when I looked again, she had
      grown so very little nearer that I abandoned this fruitless proceeding.
      Charley&rsquo;s boat had gone ahead to announce the good news to General Rieppe
      as soon as possible. But if our return was long to me, to Hortense it was
      not so. She sat beside her lover in the stern, and I knew that he was more
      to her than ever: it was her spirit also that wanted him now. Poor Kitty&rsquo;s
      words of prophecy had come perversely true: &ldquo;Something will happen, and
      that boy&rsquo;ll be conspicuous.&rdquo; Well, it had happened with a vengeance, and
      all wrong for Kitty, and all wrong for me! Then I remembered Charley, last
      of all. My doubt as to what he would have done, had he been on deck, was
      settled later by learning from his own lips that he did not know how to
      swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the sentimental world (and by that I mean the immense and mournful
      preponderance of fools, and not the few of true sentiment) would soon be
      exclaiming: &ldquo;How romantic! She found her heart! She had a glimpse of
      Death&rsquo;s angel, and in that light saw her life&rsquo;s true happiness!&rdquo; But I
      should say nothing like that, nor would Miss Josephine St. Michael, if I
      read that lady at all right. She didn&rsquo;t know what I did about Hortense.
      She hadn&rsquo;t overheard Sophistication confessing amorous curiosity about
      Innocence; but the old Kings Port lady&rsquo;s sound instinct would tell her
      that a souse in the water wasn&rsquo;t likely to be enough to wash away the
      seasoning of a lifetime; and she would wait, as I should, for the day when
      Hortense, having had her taste of John&rsquo;s innocence, and having grown used
      to the souse in the water, would wax restless for the Replacers, for
      excitement, for complexity, for the prismatic life. Then it might interest
      her to corrupt John; but if she couldn&rsquo;t, where would her occupation be,
      and how were they going to pull through?
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, there sat Hortense in the stern, melted into whatever best she
      was capable of; it had come into her face, her face was to be read&mdash;for
      the first time since I had known it&mdash;and, strangely enough, I
      couldn&rsquo;t read John&rsquo;s at all. It seemed happy, which was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way enough!&rdquo; he cried suddenly, and, at his command, the sailor and I
      took in our oars. Here was Hermana&rsquo;s gangway, and crowding faces above,
      and ejaculations and tears from Kitty. Yes, Hortense would have liked that
      return voyage to last longer. I was first on the gangway, and stood to
      wait and give them a hand out; but she lingered, and; rising slowly, spoke
      her first word to him, softly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I owe you my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I restore it to you complete,&rdquo; said John, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      None could have heard it but myself&mdash;unless the sailor, beyond whose
      comprehension it was&mdash;and I doubted for a moment if I could have
      heard right; but it was for a moment only. Hortense stood stiff, and then,
      turning, came in front of him, and I read her face for an instant longer
      before the furious hate in it was mastered to meet her father&rsquo;s embrace,
      as I helped her up the gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daughter mine!&rdquo; said the General, with a magnificent break in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hortense was game to the end. She took Kitty&rsquo;s-hysterics and the men&rsquo;s
      various grades of congratulation; her word to Gazza would have been
      supreme, but for his imperishable rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you you wouldn&rsquo;t jump,&rdquo; was what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazza stretched both arms, pointing to John. &ldquo;But a native! He was surer
      to find you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this they all remembered John, whom they thus far hadn&rsquo;t thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that lion-hearted boy?&rdquo; the General called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      John hadn&rsquo;t got out of the boat; he thought he ought to change his
      clothes, he said; and when Charley, truly astonished, proffered his entire
      wardrobe and reminded him of lunch, it was thank you very much, but if he
      could be put ashore&mdash;I looked for Hortense, to see what she would do,
      but Hortense, had gone below with Kitty to change her clothes, and the
      genuinely hearty protestations from all the rest brought merely pleasantly
      firm politeness from John, as he put on again the coat he had flung off on
      jumping. At least he would take a drink, urged Charley. Yes, thank you, he
      would; and he chose brandy-and-soda, of which he poured himself a
      remarkably stiff one. Charley and I poured ourselves milder ones, for the
      sake of company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how,&rdquo; said Charley to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s how,&rdquo; I added more emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at Charley with a somewhat extraordinary smile. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      unquestionably how!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a gay lunch; I should have supposed there was plenty of room in the
      Hermana&rsquo;s refrigerator; nor did the absence of Hortense and John, the
      cause of our jubilation, at all interfere with the jubilation itself; by
      the time the launch was ready to put me ashore, Gazza had sung several
      miles of &ldquo;good music&rdquo; and double that quantity of &ldquo;razzla-dazzla,&rdquo; and
      General Rieppe was crying copiously, and assuring everybody that God was
      very good to him. But Kitty had told us all that she intended Hortense to
      remain quiet in her cabin; and she kept her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly, as the launch was speeding me toward Kings Port, I
      exclaimed aloud: &ldquo;The cake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, I thought, the cake was now settled forever.

    <h2>
      XXII: Behind the Times
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was my lot to attend but one of the weddings which Hortense
      precipitated (or at least determined) by her plunge into the water; and,
      truth to say, the honor of my presence at the other was not requested;
      therefore I am unable to describe the nuptials of Hortense and Charley.
      But the papers were full of them; what the female guests wore, what the
      male guests were worth, and what both ate and drank, were set forth in
      many columns of printed matter; and if you did not happen to see this,
      just read the account of the next wedding that occurs among the New York
      yellow rich, and you will know how Charley and Hortense were married; for
      it&rsquo;s always the same thing. The point of mark in this particular ceremony
      of union lay in Charley&rsquo;s speech; Charley found a happy thought at the
      breakfast. The bridal party (so the papers had it) sat on a dais, and was
      composed exclusively of Oil, Sugar, Beef, Steel, and Union Pacific; merely
      at this one table five hundred million dollars were sitting (so the papers
      computed), and it helped the bridegroom to his idea, when, by the
      importunate vociferations of the company, he was forced to get on his
      unwilling legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poets and people of that sort say&rdquo; (Charley concluded, after thanking
      them) &ldquo;that happiness cannot be bought with money. Well, I guess a poet
      never does learn how to make a dollar do a dollar&rsquo;s work. But I am no
      poet; and I have learned it is as well to have a few dollars around. And I
      guess that my friends and I, right here at this table, could organize a
      corner in happiness any day we chose. And if we do, we will let you all in
      on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am told that the bride looked superb, both in church and at the
      reception which took place in the house of Kitty; and that General Rieppe,
      in spite of his shattered health, maintained a noble appearance through
      the whole ordeal of parting with his daughter. I noticed that Beverly
      Rodgers and Gazza figured prominently among the invited guests: Bohm did
      not have to be invited, for some time before the wedding he had become the
      husband of the successfully divorced Kitty. So much for the nuptials of
      Hortense and Charley; they were, as one paper pronounced them, &ldquo;up to date
      and distingue.&rdquo; The paper omitted the accent in the French word, which
      makes it, I think, fit this wedding even more happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Hortense,&rdquo; I said to myself as I read the paper, &ldquo;has squared herself
      with Charley after all.&rdquo; And I sat wondering if she would be happy. But
      she was not constructed for happiness. You cannot be constructed for all
      the different sorts of experiences which this world offers: each of our
      natures has its specialty. Hortense was constructed for pleasure; and I
      have no doubt she got it, if not through Charley, then by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage of Eliza La Heu and John Mayrant was of a different quality;
      no paper pronounced it &ldquo;up to date,&rdquo; or bestowed any other adjectival
      comments upon it; for, being solemnized in Kings Port, where such purely
      personal happenings are still held (by the St. Michael family, at any
      rate) to be no business of any one&rsquo;s save those immediately concerned, the
      event escaped the famishment of publicity. Yes, this marriage was
      solemnized, a word that I used above without forethought, and now repeat
      with intention; for certainly no respecter of language would write it of
      the yellow rich and their blatant unions. If you&rsquo;re a Bohm or a Charley,
      you may trivialize or vulgarize or bestialize your wedding, but solemnize
      it you don&rsquo;t, for that is not &ldquo;up to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to the marriage of Eliza and John I went; for not only was the honor
      of my presence requested, but John wrote me, in both their names, a
      personal note, which came to me far away in the mountains, whither I had
      gone from Kings Port. This was the body of the note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the formal invitation which you will receive, Miss La Heu joins her
      wish with mine that you will not be absent on that day. We should both
      really miss you. Miss La Heu begs me to add that if this is not sufficient
      inducement, you shall have a slice of Lady Baltimore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a long note! But you will imagine how genuinely I was touched by their
      joint message. I was not an old acquaintance, and I had done little to
      help them in their troubles, but I came into the troubles; with their
      memory of those days I formed a part, and it was a part which it warmed me
      to know they did not dislike to recall. I had actually been present at
      their first meeting, that day when John visited the Exchange to order his
      wedding-cake, and Eliza had rushed after him, because in his embarrassment
      he had forgotten to tell her the date for which he wanted it. The cake had
      begun it, the cake had continued it, the cake had brought them together;
      and in Eliza&rsquo;s retrospect now I doubted If she could find the moment when
      her love for John had awakened; but if with women there ever is such a
      moment, then, as I have before said, it was when the girl behind the
      counter looked across at the handsome, blushing boy, and felt stirred to
      help him in his stumbling attempts to be businesslike about that cake. If
      his youth unwittingly kindled hers, how could he or she help that? But,
      had he ever once known it and shown it to her during his period of bondage
      to Hortense, then, indeed, the flame would have turned to ice in Eliza&rsquo;s
      breast. What saved him for her was his blind steadfastness against her.
      That was the very thing she prized most, once it became hers; whereas, any
      secret swerving toward her from Hortense during his heavy hours of
      probation would have degraded John to nothing in Eliza&rsquo;s eyes. And so,
      making all this out by myself in the mountains after reading John&rsquo;s note,
      I ordered from the North the handsomest old china cake-dish that Aunt
      Carola could find to be sent to Miss Eliza La Heu with my card. I wanted
      to write on the card, &ldquo;Rira bien qui viva le dernier&rdquo;; but alas! so many
      pleasant thoughts may never be said aloud in this world of ours. That I
      ordered china, instead of silver, was due to my surmise that in Kings Port&mdash;or
      at any rate by Mrs. Weguelin and Miss Josephine St. Michael&mdash;silver
      from any one not of the family would be considered vulgar; it was only a
      surmise, and, of course, it was precisely the sort of thing that I could
      not verify by asking any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But (you may be asking) how on earth did all this come about? What
      happened in Kings Port on the day following that important swim which
      Hortense and John took together in the waters of the harbor?
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish that I could tell you all that happened, but I can only tell you of
      the outside of things; the inside was wholly invisible and inaudible to
      me, although we may be sure, I think, that when the circles that widened
      from Hortense&rsquo;s plunge reached the shores of the town, there must have
      been in certain quarters a considerable splashing. I presume that John
      communicated to somebody the news of his broken engagement; for if he
      omitted to do so, with the wedding invitations to be out the next day, he
      was remiss beyond excuse, and I think this very unlikely; and I also
      presume (with some evidence to go on) that Hortense did not, in the
      somewhat critical juncture of her fortunes, allow the grass to grow under
      her feet&mdash;if such an expression may be used of a person who is shut
      up in the stateroom of a steam yacht. To me John Mayrant made no sign of
      any sort by word or in writing, and this is the highest proof he ever gave
      me of his own delicacy, and also of his reliance upon mine; for he must
      have been pretty sure that I had overheard those last destiny-deciding
      words spoken between himself and Hortense in the boat, as we reached the
      Hermana&rsquo;s gangway. In John&rsquo;s place almost any man, even Beverly Rodgers,
      would have either dropped a hint at the moment, or later sent me some line
      to the effect that the incident was, of course, &ldquo;between ourselves.&rdquo; That
      would have been both permissible and practical; but there it was, the
      difference between John of Kings Port and us others; he was not practical
      when it came to something &ldquo;between gentlemen,&rdquo; as he would have said. The
      finest flower of breeding blossoms above the level of the practical, and
      that is why you do not find it growing in the huge truck-garden of our
      age, save in corners where it has not yet been uprooted. John&rsquo;s silence to
      me was something that I liked very much, and he must have found that it
      was not misplaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first external splash of the few that I have to narrate was a negative
      manifestation, and occurred at breakfast: Juno supposed if the wedding
      invitations would be out later in the day. The next splash was somewhat
      louder on, was at dinner, when Juno inquired of Mrs. Trevise if she had
      received any wedding invitation. At tea time was very decided splashing.
      No invitation had come to anybody. Juno had called at five of the St.
      Michael houses and got in at none of them, and there was a rumor that the
      Hermana had disappeared from the harbor. So far, none of the splashing had
      wet me but I now came in for a light sprinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not on board that boat yesterday?&rdquo; Juno inquired; and to see her
      look at me you might have gathered that I was suspected of sinking the
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most delightful occasion!&rdquo; I exclaimed, filling my face with a bright
      blankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he awful to speak that way about Sunday!&rdquo; said the up-country
      bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a chance for the poetess, and she took it. &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; she mused,
      &ldquo;every day seems fraught with an equal holiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should think,&rdquo; observed the Briton, &ldquo;that you could knock off a
      hymn better on Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this while Juno was looking at me, and I knew it, and therefore I ate
      my food in a kindly sort of unconscious way, until she fired another shot
      at me. &ldquo;There is an absurd report that somebody fell overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;So that is what it has grown to already! I did go
      out on the boat boom, and I did drop off&mdash;but into a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this confession of mine the up-country bride became extraordinarily
      arch on the subject of the well-known hospitality of steam yachts, and for
      this I was honestly grateful to her; but Juno brooded still. &ldquo;I hope there
      is nothing wrong,&rdquo; she said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that silence at this point would not be golden, I went into it
      with spirit I told them of our charming party, of General Rieppe&rsquo;s rich
      store of quotations, of the strict discipline on board the well-appointed
      Hermana, of the great beauty of Hortense, and her evident happiness when
      her lover was by her side. This talk of mine turned off any curiosity or
      suspicion which the rest of the company may have begun to entertain; but
      upon Juno I think it made scant impression, save causing her to set me
      down as an imbecile. For there was Doctor Beaugarcon when we came into the
      sitting-room, who told us before any one could even say &ldquo;How-do-you-do,&rdquo;
       that Miss Hortense Rieppe had broken her engagement with John Mayrant, and
      that he had it from Mrs. Cornerly, whom he was visiting professionally. I
      caught the pitying look which Juno threw at me at this news, and I was
      happy to have acquitted myself so creditably in the manipulation of my
      secret: nobody asked me any more questions!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is almost nothing else to tell you of how the splashes broke on
      Kings Port. Before the day when I was obliged to call in Doctor
      Beaugarcon&rsquo;s professional services (quite a sharp attack put me to bed for
      half a week) I found merely the following things: the Hermana gone to New
      York, the automobiles and the Replacers had also disappeared, and people
      were divided on the not strikingly important question as to whether
      Hortense and the General had accompanied Charley on the yacht, or
      continued northward in an automobile, or taken the train. Gone, in any
      case, the whole party indubitably was, leaving, I must say, a sense of
      emptiness: the comedy was over, the players departed. I never heard any
      one, not even Juno, doubt that it was Hortense who had broken the
      engagement; this part of the affair was conducted by the principals with
      great skill. Hortense had evidently written her version to the Cornerlys,
      and not a word to any other effect ever came from John&rsquo;s mouth, of course.
      One result I had not looked for, though it was a natural one: if the old
      ladies had felt indignation at Hortense for her determination to marry
      John Mayrant, this indignation was doubled by her determination not to! I
      fear that few of us live by logic, even in Kings Port; and then, they had
      all called upon her in that garden for nothing! The sudden thought of this
      made me laugh alone in my bed of sickness; and when I came out of it, had
      such a thing been possible, I should have liked to congratulate Miss
      Josephine St. Michael on her absence from the garden occasion. I said,
      however, nothing to her, or to any of the other ladies, upon this or any
      subject, for I was so unlucky as to find them not at home when I paid my
      round of farewell visits. Nor (to my real distress) did I see John Mayrant
      again. The boy wrote me (I received it in bed) a short, warm note of
      regret, with nothing else in it save the fact that he was leaving town,
      having become free from the Custom House at last. I fancy that he ran away
      for a judicious interval. Who would not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there one person to whom he told the truth before he went? Did the
      girl behind the counter hear the manner in which the engagement was
      broken? Ah, none of us will ever know that! But, although I could not,
      without the highest impropriety, have spoken to any of the old ladies
      about this business, unless they had chosen to speak to me&mdash;and
      somehow I feel that after the abrupt close of it not even Mrs. Gregory St.
      Michael would have been likely to touch on the subject with an outsider&mdash;there
      was nothing whatever to forbid my indulging in a skirmish with Eliza La
      Heu; therefore I lunched at the Exchange on my last day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the mountains?&rdquo; she said, in reply to my information about my plans of
      travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Beaugarcon says nothing else can so quickly restore me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay there for the rhododendrons, then,&rdquo; she bade me. &ldquo;No sight more
      beautiful in all the South.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Town seems deserted,&rdquo; I pursued. &ldquo;Everybody gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not everybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the interesting people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant, interesting to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw her decide not to be angry; and her decision changed and saved our
      conversation from the trashy, bantering tone which it was taking, and
      brought it to a pass most unexpected to both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a charming and friendly smile. &ldquo;Well, you, at any rate, are
      going away. And I am really sorry for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested upon me with perfect frankness. I was not in love with
      Eliza La Heu, but nearer to love than I had ever been then, and it would
      have been easy, very easy, to let one&rsquo;s self go straight onward into love.
      There are for a man more ways of falling into that state than romancers
      would have us to believe, and one of them is by an assent of the will at a
      certain given moment, which the heart promptly follows&mdash;just as a man
      in a moment decides he will espouse a cause, and soon finds himself hotly
      fighting for it body and soul. I could have gone out of that Exchange
      completely in love with Eliza La Heu; but my will did not give its assent,
      and I saw John Mayrant not as a rival, but as one whose happiness I
      greatly desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for telling me you are sorry I am going. And now,
      may I treat you more than ever as a friend, and tell you of a circumstance
      which Kings Port does not know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It put her on her guard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be indiscreet,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t timely indiscretion discretion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be clever,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me what you have to say&mdash;if
      you&rsquo;re quite sure you&rsquo;ll not be sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. There&rsquo;s no reason&mdash;now that the untruth is properly and
      satisfactorily established&mdash;that one person should not know that John
      Mayrant broke that engagement.&rdquo; And I told her the whole of it. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
      outrageous to share this secret with you,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;I can only say
      that I couldn&rsquo;t stand the unfairness any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He jumped straight in?&rdquo; said Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, straight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just after declaring that he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she murmured again. &ldquo;And the current took them right away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he very tired when you got to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered this question and a number of others, backward and forward,
      until she had led me to cover the whole incident about twice-and-a-half
      times. Then she had a silence, and after this a reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well they managed it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Managed what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accepted version.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you and I will not spoil it for them,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I took my final leave of her she put a flower in my buttonhole. My
      reflection was then, and is now, that if she already knew the truth from
      John himself, how well she managed it!
    </p>
    <p>
      So that same night I took the lugubrious train which bore me with the
      grossest deliberation to the mountains; and among the mountains and their
      waterfalls I stayed and saw the rhododendrons, and was preparing to
      journey home when the invitation came from John and Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already said that of this wedding no word was in the papers. Kings
      Port by the war lost all material things, but not the others, among which
      precious privacy remains to her; and, O Kings Port, may you never lose
      your grasp of that treasure! May you never know the land where the
      reporter blooms, where if any joy or grief befall you, the public press
      rings your doorbell and demands the particulars, and if you deny it the
      particulars, it makes them up and says something scurrilous about you into
      the bargain. Therefore nothing was printed, morning or evening, about John
      and Eliza. Nor was the wedding service held in church to the accompaniment
      of nodding bonnets and gaping stragglers. No eye not tender with regard
      and emotion looked on while John took Eliza to his wedded wife, to live
      together after God&rsquo;s ordinance in the holy state of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Royal Street, not many steps from South Place, there stands a quiet
      house a little back, upon whose face sorrow has struck many blows, but
      made no deep wounds yet; no scorch from the fires of war is visible, and
      the rending of the earthquake does not show too plainly; but there hangs
      about the house a gravity that comes from seeing and suffering much, and a
      sweetness from having sheltered many generations of smiles and tears. The
      long linked chain of births and deaths here has not been broken and
      scattered, and the grandchildren look out of the same windows from which
      the grandsires gazed, whose faces now in picture frames still watch
      serenely the sad present from their happy past. Therefore the rooms lie in
      still depths of association, and from the walls, the stairs, the
      furniture, flows the benign influence of undispersed memories; it sheds
      its tempered radiance upon the old miniatures, and upon every fresh flower
      that comes in from the garden; it seems to pass through the open doors to
      and fro like a tranquil blessing; it is beyond joy and pain, because time
      has distilled it from both of these; it is the assembled essence of
      kinship and blood unity, enriched by each succeeding brood that is born,
      is married, is fruitful in its turn, and dies remembered; only the balm of
      faith is stronger to sustain and heal; for that comes from heaven, while
      it is earth that gives us this; and the sacred cup of it which our native
      land once held is almost empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid this influence John and Eliza were made one, and the faces of the
      older generations grew soft beneath it, and pensive eyes became lustrous,
      and into pale cheeks the rosy tint came like an echo faintly back for a
      short hour. They made so little sound in their quiet happiness of
      congratulation that it might have been a dream; and they were so few that
      the house with the sense of its memories was not lost with the movement
      and crowding, but seemed still to preside over the whole, and send down
      its benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was my turn to shake the hands of bride and groom, John asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did your friend do with your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I replied. &ldquo;He has taken it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not that,&rdquo; John returned, &ldquo;but you must have helped him to see
      his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the bride came to cut the cake, she called me to her and fulfilled
      her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always liked my baking,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you made it after all,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have been married without doing so,&rdquo; she declared sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for them to go away, they were surrounded with
      affectionate God-speeds; but Miss Josephine St. Michael waited to be the
      last, standing a little apart, her severe and chiselled face turned aside,
      and seeming to watch a mocking-bird that was perched in his cage at a
      window halfway up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is usually not so silent,&rdquo; Miss Josephine said to me. &ldquo;I suppose we
      are too many visitors for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that the old lady, beneath her severity, was deeply moved; and
      almost at once John and Eliza came down the stairs. Miss Josephine took
      each of them to her heart, but she did not trust herself to speak; and a
      single tear rolled down her face, as the boy and girl continued to the
      hall-door. There Daddy Ben stood, and John&rsquo;s gay good-by to him was the
      last word that I heard the bridegroom say. While we all stood silently
      watching them as they drove away from the tall iron gate, the mocking-bird
      on the staircase broke into melodious ripples of song.

    <h2>
      XXIII: Poor Aunt Carola!
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now here goes my language back into the small-clothes that it wore at
      the beginning of all, when I told you something of that colonial society,
      the Selected Salic Scions, dear to the heart of my Aunt. It were beyond my
      compass to approach this august body of men and women with the respect
      that is its due, did I attire myself in that modern garment which, in the
      phrase of the vulgar, is denoted pants.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will scarce have forgot, I must suppose, the importance set by my Aunt
      Carola upon the establishing of the Scions in new territories, wherever
      such persons as were both qualified by their descent and in themselves
      worthy, should be found; and you will remember that I was bidden by her to
      look in South Carolina for members of the Bombo connection which she was
      inclined to suspect existed in that state. My neglect to make this inquiry
      for my kind Aunt now smote me sharply when all seemed too late. John
      Mayrant had spoken of Kill-devil Bombo, the very personage through whom
      lay Aunt Carola&rsquo;s claim to kingly lineage, and I had let John Mayrant go
      away upon his honeymoon without ever questioning him upon this subject. As
      I looked back upon the ease with which I might have settled the matter,
      and forward to my return empty-handed to the generous relative to whom I
      owed this agreeable experience of travel, I felt guilty indeed. I wrote a
      letter to follow John Mayrant into whatever retreat of bliss he had
      betaken himself to, and I begged him earnestly to write me at his early
      convenience all that he might know of Bombos in South Carolina.
      Consequently, I was able, on reaching home, to meet Aunt Carola with some
      sort of countenance, and to assure her that I expected presently to be
      furnished with authentic and valuable particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now learned that the Selected Salic Scions had greatly increased in
      numbers during my short absence. It appeared that the origin of the whole
      movement had sprung from a needy but ingenious youth in some manufacturing
      town of New England. This lad had a cousin, who had amassed from nothing a
      noble fortune by inventing one day a speedy and convenient fashion of
      opening beer bottles; and this cousin&rsquo;s achievement had set him to looking
      about him. He soon discovered that in our great republic everywhere there
      were living hundreds and thousands of men and women who were utterly
      unaware that they were descended from kings. Borrowing a little money to
      float him, he set up The American Almanach de Gotha and began (for the
      minimum sum of fifty dollars a pedigree) to reveal to these eager people
      the chain of links that connected them with royalty. Thus, in a period of
      time the brevity of which is incredible, this young man passed from
      complete indigence to a wife and four automobiles, or an automobile and
      four wives&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember which he had the four of. There was so
      much royal blood about that it had spilled into several rival
      organizations, each bitterly warring with the other; but my Aunt assured
      me that her society was the only one that any respectable person belonged
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am minded to announce a rule of discreet conduct: Never read aloud any
      letter that you have not first read to yourself. Had I observed this rule&mdash;but
      listen:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Aunt Carola was at luncheon with us when the postman
      brought John Mayrant&rsquo;s answer to my inquiry, and at the sight of his
      handwriting I thoughtlessly exclaimed to my Aunt that here at last we had
      all there was to be known concerning the Bombos in South Carolina; with
      this I tore open the missive and embarked upon a reading of it for the
      edification of all present. I pass over the beginning of John&rsquo;s
      communication, because it was merely the observations of a man upon his
      honeymoon, and was confined to laudatory accounts of scenery and weather,
      and the beauty of all life when once one saw it with his eyes truly
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Bombos ever came to Carolina,&rdquo; he now continued, &ldquo;that I know of, or
      that Aunt Josephine knows of, which is more to the point. Aunt Josephine
      has copied me a passage from the writings of William Byrd, Esq., of
      Westover, Virginia, in which mention is made, not of the family, but of a
      rum punch which seems to have been concocted first by Admiral Bombo, from
      a New England brand of rum so very deadly that it was not inaptly styled
      &lsquo;kill-devil&rsquo; by the early planters of the colony. That the punch drifted
      to Carolina and still survives there, you have reason to know. Therefore
      if any remote ancestors of yours contracted an alliance with Kill-devil
      Bombo, I can imagine no resulting offspring of such union but a series of
      severe attacks of delir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; interrupted Aunt Carola, at this point, in her most formidable
      voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that stuff you&rsquo;re reading, Augustus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook in my shoes. &ldquo;Why, Aunt, it&rsquo;s John&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another word, sir! And never let me hear his name again. To think&mdash;to
      think&mdash;&rdquo; But here Aunt Carola&rsquo;s face grew extremely red, and she
      choked so decidedly that Uncle Andrew poured her a glass of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of our luncheon was conducted with remarkable solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were rising from table, my Aunt said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was high time, Augustus, that you came home. You seem to have got into
      very strange company down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the last reference to the Bombos that my Aunt ever made in my
      hearing. Of course it is preposterous to suppose that she traces her
      descent from a king through a mere bowl of punch, and her being still the
      president of the Selected Salic Scions is proof irrefutable that her claim
      rests upon a more solid foundation.

    <h2>
      XXIV: Post Scriptum
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think that John Mayrant, Jr., is going to look like his mother. I was
      very glad to be present when he was christened, and at this ceremony I did
      not feel as I had felt the year before at the wedding; for then I had
      known well enough that if the old ladies found any blemish on that
      occasion, it was my being there! To them I must remain forever a &ldquo;Yankee,&rdquo;
       a wall perfectly imaginary and perfectly real between us; and the fact
      that young John could take any other view of me, was to them a sign of
      that &ldquo;radical&rdquo; tendency in him which they were able to forgive solely
      because he was of the younger generation and didn&rsquo;t know any better.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with these thoughts in my mind, and remembering a certain very grave
      talk I had once held with Eliza in the Exchange about the North and the
      South, in which it was my good fortune to make her see that there is on
      our soil nowadays such a being as an American, who feels, wherever he goes
      in our native land, that it is all his, and that he belongs everywhere to
      it, I looked at the little John Mayrant, and then I said to his mother:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you teach him &lsquo;Dixie&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yankee Doodle&rsquo; as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Eliza smiled at me with friendly, inscrutable eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t ask too much of the ladies. I&rsquo;ll see to all
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he will. And an education at Harvard College need not cause the
      boy to forget his race, or his name, or his traditions, but only to value
      them more, as they should be valued. And the way that they should be
      valued is this: that the boy in thinking of them should say to himself, &ldquo;I
      am proud of my ancestors; let my life make them proud of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, in any case, is it not pleasant to think of the boy being brought up
      by Eliza, and not by Hortense?
    </p>
    <p>
      And so my portrait of Kings Port is finished. That the likeness is not
      perfect, I am only too sensible. No painter that I have heard of ever
      satisfies the whole family. But, should any of the St. Michaels see this
      picture, I trust they may observe that if some of the touches are faulty,
      true admiration and love of his subject animated the artist&rsquo;s hand; and if
      Miss Josephine St. Michael should be pleased with any of it, I could wish
      that she might indicate this by sending me a Lady Baltimore; we have no
      cake here that approaches it.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
